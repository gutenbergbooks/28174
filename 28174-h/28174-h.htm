<p><i>For many years I have had opportunities of
inspecting and reporting upon Collections of Books
in numerous Country Houses, and I must say that
the condition of books in the greater number of them

pictures, his objets d'art, his horses, his
garden, and his bicycle, but rarely will he talk
about his books; and if he does so, all his geese are
swans, or just as often, all his swans are geese.
There are servants in every house qualified to do
everything except handle a book. There is no reason
why the Library should not be just as much a place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi"></a><a href="images/vi.png">[vi]</a></span>
of amusement as the billiard-room, where the men
are usually to be found. Books are much more
amusing than billiards, and you may learn to play
in jest or work in earnest with books just as you take
to any other amusement. The whole truth is that at
present books do not get a proper share of attention,
and it is with the desire to remedy such a condition
of things that I have printed this little volume, containing
things that we do know, that we don't know,
and that we ought to know about our books.</i></p>

<h2><span class='u'><i>What is a Good Edition?</i></span></h2>


<p>A good edition should be a complete edition,
ungarbled and unabridged. If the author is
a classic, the <i>format</i> of the copy chosen should
in some way represent the style of the author.
<i>Gibbon</i>, for instance, should be in large octavo
or quarto, with print of a size to correspond.
This is not always possible, for English editions
of books often aim at mere cheapness, and of
many great authors there exist no good editions.
Thus there is no suitable edition of the classics
printed in England, as there is and for long
has been in France. A good edition is not
necessarily an expensive edition, nor is it
necessarily noble and generous in print and
margin. The editions known as the 'Globe'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a><a href="images/2.png">[2]</a></span>
editions of Pope and others are good editions
because (1) They are complete; (2) Each one
has been taken in hand and superintended
by the most competent scholar and has
notes sufficient but not pedantic; (3) Because
they are well printed on paper of fair quality
by printers who give wages liberally to careful
press readers; (4) Because each work being
a work of the first or classic order, it is
bound in a simple and unaffected style, without
meretricious gold or tawdry ornament.
Now the 'Globe' editions are fitting in their
place as types of right editions of the cheap
kind. I will now take right editions of
the more liberal and expensive kind. The
'Cambridge' <i>Shakespeare</i>, the last issue, each
play in a separate volume, is right because
(1) The print, paper, spacing, and simplicity
of binding, are suited to the dignity of the
work; (2) The edition has had brought to it
fulness of knowledge and rightness of judgment;
(3) Each volume is light to handle
and easy to hold, and flexible in opening.</p>

<p>But it would be misleading to say that
these are the only examples of right editions.
In other books which I might name, excellent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a><a href="images/3.png">[3]</a></span>
work has been brought to play which in the
two types already named there was not scope
for. I would like therefore to take another
instance, and name the editions of Pope's
<i>Works</i>, edited by Courthope and Elwin, of
Walpole's <i>Letters</i>, edited by Peter Cunningham,
and Boswell's <i>Johnson</i>, edited by Birkbeck
Hill. These editions contain excellent
and workmanlike features, such as good
arrangement and good indexing, with notes
and elucidations sufficiently ample. The size
too of each volume is not extravagant as in
certain <i>&eacute;ditions de luxe</i>. Now in order that
we may have good editions, there are, at least,
ten people who must work well together:
(1) the Author, (2) the Publisher, (3) the Printer,
(4) the Reader, (5) the Compositor, (6) the
Pressman, (7) the Paper Maker, (8) the Ink
Maker, (9) the Bookbinder, (10) the Consumer.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
When these ten people are not working in
harmony, a book is spoilt. Too often the
author, without technical knowledge of book
production, insists on certain whims and fancies
of his own being carried out. Too often the
publisher aims at cheapness and nothing more.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a><a href="images/4.png">[4]</a></span></p>
<p>The publications issued by Pickering in the
'forties' and 'fifties' were models of good workmanship.
Pickering published and Whittingham
printed, and it was their custom to first sit in consultation
upon every new book, and painfully
hammer out each in his own mind its ideal form
and proportions. Then two Sundays at least
were required to compare notes in the little
summer house in Mr. Whittingham's garden
at Chiswick. Here they would discuss size and
quality of paper, the shape of the printed page,
the number of lines, the size of the type, the
form and comeliness of the title-page.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In all
technical details the <i>Edinburgh</i> edition of R. L.
Stevenson's works is satisfying. Here are more
'lines of beauty' than in almost any other modern
printed book. As we handle it we feel <i>satisfied</i>
that it <i>is right</i>. Perhaps it was such a <i>format</i>
that Mr. Ruskin had in mind when he shaped
out a scheme of a Royal series of books, which
should be models of good work all round.
And though it is necessary that we have cheap
editions, and that books should circulate everywhere,
we want to save the book trade from
shoddy work by keeping good models before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a><a href="images/5.png">[5]</a></span>
us. That we produce the best thought in
the best form, and not in any mean, shabby
dress, ought indeed to be a serious aim of
everybody engaged in the matter.</p>




<h2><span class='u'><i>What is a Fine Copy?</i></span></h2>


<p>To judge of a fine copy requires some
years' handling of books. To some, the
school prize, in light brown calf, represents
an ideal of book beauty; to others, a padded
binding and round corners. But these are
neither beautiful nor in any way fine copies.
The school prize book is not a fine copy
(1) Because it is bound in a very perishable
leather; (2) Because its margins have been
trimmed away and ploughed into; (3) Because
it is received in a form which renders it impossible
to stamp one's own individuality upon
it; (4) It has gaudy and meaningless ornaments
stamped down the back. The padded
binding is impossible as a fine copy because
it has had applied to it a wholly incongruous
method of preservation. Books require to be
clothed, but not to be upholstered. The
round corners usually adopted by the upholster<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a><a href="images/6.png">[6]</a></span>
binder can claim no advantage, and
they rob the book of its natural neatness
and squareness of edge. School prize bindings
and padded bindings are sins against the
sanctity of common sense. What then is a
fine copy? Almost, though not entirely,
essential is it that it be in the original binding
as put out by the publisher, whether it be a
paper covering, or cloth, or boards. The
reason for this is that in securing a book in
such a condition one has the book <i>in full
measure</i>, and there is no necessity to undo
anything which has already been done. Now,
if a book be bought in a leather binding, the
chances are that it is a leather binding which
in no way suits its new owner, and he therefore
has not only to sacrifice the binding, but
in rebinding it he must sacrifice some of the
margins too. The novels of Scott and Marryat
in their original boards are delightful to handle.
A fine copy should be a clean copy free
from spots. When a book is spotted it
is called 'foxed,' and these 'foxey' books are
for the most part books printed in the early
part of this century, when paper-makers first
discovered that they could bleach their rags,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a><a href="images/7.png">[7]</a></span>
and, owing to the inefficient means used to neutralise
the bleach, the book carried the seeds of
decay in itself, and when exposed to any damp
soon became discoloured with brown stains.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
A foxed book cannot have the fox marks
removed, and such a book should be avoided.
Ink marks can be removed, and a name written
upon a title-page can generally be entirely obliterated
without leaving any sign that it has been
there. Here let me beg people who give presents
of books never to write upon title-pages, but
upon the fly-leaf. Many thousands of beautiful
and valuable volumes are annually ruined for
ever by their owners cutting the name from
the title. A cut title-page is irreparable.
A fine copy may be a bound copy, in which
case the edges must not have been cut down,
though the top edge may have been gilded,
and the binding must be appropriate and not
provincial in appearance. A provincial binding
lacks finish, the board used is too thick or
too thin, or not of good quality, and the
leather not properly pared down and turned in.
All such things go to spoil good books. In
North's <i>Lives of the Norths</i> there is a passage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a><a href="images/8.png">[8]</a></span>
which well describes the man of judgment in
books. Dr. John North, whose life forms
part of this work, is most picturesquely
described in his book-loving habits. 'He
courted, as a fond lover, all best editions,
fairest characters, best bound and preserved.
If the subject were in his favour (as the
Classics), he cared not how many of them he
had, even of the same edition, if he thought
it among the best, <i>rather better bound, squarer
cut, neater covers, or some such qualification
caught him</i>.' And then his biographer adds,
what is so true, and especially of books, 'Continual
use gives men a judgment of things comparatively,
and they come to fix on what is most
proper and easy, which no man upon cursory
view would determine.'</p>

<p>Large paper copies are not necessarily fine
copies. When a cheap trumpery piece of
book-making is printed on hand-made paper
or Japanese vellum paper the result is vulgarity,
just as when a common person attempts
to swagger about in fine clothes. No, a book
must show good binding and be appropriately
apparelled, or it cannot be referred to as a
fine copy. In the matter of large paper copies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a><a href="images/9.png">[9]</a></span>
it is necessary to form a separate judgment
in each case. One thing is certain, that the
man who collects large paper books as large
paper books is a vulgarian and a fool. He
who collects such large paper books as mature
judgment determines are appropriate, and because
he sees them to have genuine points of
merit over and above small paper copies, is a
book lover. In a charming little volume, written
by an American bibliophile, I read the following
passage, confirming in part the foregoing:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Good editions of good books, though they
may often be expensive, cannot be too highly
commended. One can turn to a page in
inviting letterpress so much easier than to a
page of an unattractive volume.'<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>




<h2><span class='u'><i>Book Values.</i></span></h2>


<p>It would be impossible to tell all the causes
which go towards determining the value of a
book and which cause it to fluctuate in price.
There is but one way to arrive at a reliable
knowledge of book values, and that is to
begin stall-hunting as soon as you leave school<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a><a href="images/10.png">[10]</a></span>
or college and continue until past middle age,
absorbing information from stalls, from catalogues,
and from sale-rooms. The records
of prices at which books have been sold in
the auction rooms, and which are regularly
issued, are useless in the hands of an inexperienced
person. To make up your mind
on Monday that you are going to begin a
career of successful bargain-hunting and book-collecting
is only to be defrauded on all the
other five remaining days. Experience must be
bought, and an eye for a good copy of a book,
or for a bargain of any kind, only comes after
years of practice. I admit that if a man
begins collecting some particular class of books,
say Angling books, he may sooner arrive at
safe judgment alone; but even here he has
a pretty wide field to make blunders in.
When Gabriel Naud&eacute; wrote his pamphlet, <i>Avis
pour dresser une Biblioth&egrave;que</i>, he laid down
his first rule thus:&mdash;'The first means is to
take the counsel and advice of such as are
able to give it <i>viva voce</i>.' This was written
more than two hundred years ago, and still no
better advice could possibly be given to a
book collector. By all means find a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a><a href="images/11.png">[11]</a></span>
whom you can trust, and whose knowledge is
ample, and stick to him. Do not yourself
bid in the auction room, or you will soon
find out your mistake. Place your list of
wants and your list of commissions in the
hands of one good man whom you have
reason to trust, and you will then get your
money's worth.</p>

<p>I have said that it is impossible to set down
all the causes which affect the prices of books,
but in an old French bibliographical book,
by D. Clement,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> the subject is gone into
more minutely than it has ever since been
treated. First, there are causes which may be
classed under the heading of <i>Rarity</i>. Secondly,
there are causes which must be grouped under
the head <i>Condition</i>.</p>

<p>According to Clement, there are two sorts
of rarity in books; the one absolute, the other
conditional or contingent. There are rare
editions of very common books. There are
books of almost common occurrence in public
libraries, which are rarely seen in the market.
A book or an edition of which but very few
copies exist is called 'necessarily rare;' one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a><a href="images/12.png">[12]</a></span>
which is only with difficulty to be met with&mdash;however
many copies may be extant&mdash;he calls
'contingently rare.'</p>

<p>Under the first head he classes; (1) Books
of which few copies were printed; (2) Books
which have been suppressed; (3) Books which
have been almost entirely destroyed by casual
fire, or other accident; (4) Books of which a
large portion of the impression has been wasted&mdash;usually
for want of success when published; (5)
Volumes of which the printing was never completed;
(6) Copies on large paper or on vellum.</p>

<p>Under the second head, he enumerates; (1)
Books on subjects which interest only a particular
class of students; (2) Books in languages
which are little known; (3) Heretical, licentious,
and libellous books; (4) First editions of a
classic author from MS.; (5) First productions
of the printing press in a particular town; (6)
The productions of the celebrated printers
of the sixteenth century; (7) Books in the
vernacular language of an author who printed
them in a foreign country; (8) Books privately
printed; (9) Works, the various parts of which
have been published under different titles, in
different sizes, or in various places.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a><a href="images/13.png">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Clement then analyses the degrees of rarity
thus: (1) Every book, which is no longer current
in the trade, and requires some pains in the search
for it, is 'of infrequent occurrence;' (2) If there
are but few copies in the country in which we
live, and those not easily met with, it is 'rare;'
(3) If the copies are so dispersed that there are
but few of them, even in the neighbouring
countries, so that there is increased difficulty to
procure them, it is 'very rare;' (4) If the
number of copies be but fifty or sixty, and those
scattered, it is 'extremely rare;' (5) And
finally, every work of which there are not ten
copies in the world is 'excessively rare.' In all
these cases, it must be supposed that the book
is a book sought for, and that the seekers are
more numerous than the sought.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>In the matter of <i>Condition</i> and its effect
upon price, long training is required before all
the qualities of a copy can be properly defined.
There are copies on 'vellum,' 'large paper,' 'fine
paper,' 'coloured paper.' There are 'crisp' copies,
'uncut' copies, 'tall' copies, 'ruled' copies,
and 'illustrated' copies, <i>cum multis aliis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><a href="images/14.png">[14]</a></span></p><p>Fashion determines much as to price. As
soon as it becomes a fad to collect books relating
to some particular subject, competition
instantly steps in, and prices go up. It may be
well to state, for the benefit of a very numerous
and uninitiated public, that, <i>because a book
is old, it is not necessarily rare</i>. There are
many thousands of people who have most
imperfect and valueless books, mostly on
theology, or some controversial abominations,
and these people spend days wasting their
own and booksellers' time in seeking to
sell at prices which their own imagination
alone has determined is right. Distrust
the advertisements of large paper editions.
<i>Very</i> few of them are worth purchasing,
and very few, indeed, increase in value.
Fight against the first-edition craze, which
is the maddest craze that ever affected book
collecting. Again and again it must be repeated,
and cannot be gainsaid, that <i>a first
edition may be the best, but in most cases it is
the worst</i>. In every case, inquire and find
out which is the <i>best</i> edition as to completeness,
good paper and print, and safe editing,
if such has been necessary, and then purchase<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a><a href="images/15.png">[15]</a></span>
a copy of that edition. One remark finally.
The prices of <i>all good books</i> are going up,
and any one who lays out money with care
within the next ten years will have the enjoyment
of his library and a good investment
as well.</p>




<h2><span class='u'><i>On the Care of Books.</i></span></h2>


<p>The two things most neglected in houses
are the trimming of lamps and the care of
the books. The condition of many libraries
in large country houses is most lamentable.
In such neglect are they that it would take
months, and in some cases years, working day
and night, to restore them to a healthy condition.
For, poor things! they are really so
neglected, that their covers become like the
limbs of rheumatic people. If you touch them
they seem to shriek and cry with pain. They
are either parched for lack of a proper atmosphere,
or else they are sticking together with
the damp or thickly covered with dust.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> There
is nothing else in a house like this, and why
are these things so? It is because there are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a><a href="images/16.png">[16]</a></span>
so few people who understand the care of
books. I once read the following in a daily
paper, and thought I recognised in it a familiar
hand, that of Mr. Andrew Lang:&mdash;</p>

<p>'The foes of books are careless people&mdash;first
of all. They tear pages open with their
thumbs, or cut them with sharp knives which
damage the margins. It is so difficult to keep
paper knives, and ivory paper knives are
the favourite pasture of some scholars, who
bite the edges till the weapon resembles a
dissipated saw. To avoid this temptation
some employ medi&aelig;val daggers, or skene dhus,
but the edges spoil a book. Cigarette ashes
are very bad for books, so is butter, also marmalade.
Dr. Johnson and Wordsworth are
said to have been very careless with their
books. Dr. Johnson used to clean his from
dust by knocking them together, as Mr.
Leighton says housemaids do. Scott was
very careful; he had a number of wooden
dummies made, and, when a volume was borrowed,
he put the dummy in its place on the
shelf, inscribing it with the name of the borrower.
He also defended his shelves with
locked brazen wires. "Tutus clausus ero" ("I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><a href="images/17.png">[17]</a></span>
shall be safe if shut up"), his anagram, was his
motto, under a portcullis. Borrowers, of
course, are nearly the worst enemies of books,
always careless, and very apt to lose one
volume out of a set. Housemaids are seldom
bibliophiles. Their favourite plan is to dust
the books in the owner's absence, and then
rearrange them on fancy principles, mostly
upside down. One volume of <i>Grote</i> will be
put among French novels, another in the
centre of a collection on sports, a third in the
midst of modern histories, while others are
"upstairs and downstairs, and in my lady's
chamber." The diversity of sizes, from folio
to duodecimo, makes books very difficult to
arrange where room is scanty. Modern
shelves in most private houses allow no room
for folios, which have to lie, like fallen warriors,
on their sides.'</p>

<p>All that is very true, particularly about
housemaids. Indeed, I have rarely found any
woman who cared sufficiently for her books
to really fondly tend them.</p>

<p>The principal enemy which books have
is <span class="smcap">Damp</span>. This means ruination, more
perhaps to the paper than to the binding,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><a href="images/18.png">[18]</a></span>
though both suffer. A fungus growth comes
on the leather, and inside there come stains and
'fox' marks. Damp is caused (1) through
lack of fires or warmth; (2) through too many
sides of a room being exposed to the elements
without having the walls battened; (3) the
thaw following a frost, proper means for
warmth not being adopted during the frost.
The only remedy for damp is the trying
process of opening each volume and suspending
it open, after wiping with a dry cloth
each page affected. The next worst enemies
are gas and heat.</p>

<p>Gas alone, provided the books are not
placed high up, will not be nearly so destructive
as it is generally supposed; but all
atmospheres heated too highly are destructive.
Mr. Poole, a very experienced American
librarian, has reported as follows, and, I think,
very rightly:&mdash;</p>

<p>'The burning of many gas lights doubtless
has a tendency to increase the evil by increasing
the heat. Yet the deterioration of
bindings goes on in the libraries where gas
is never used. This fact shows that the
chief injury arises from heat, and not merely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a><a href="images/19.png">[19]</a></span>
from the sulphurous residuum of gas combustion.'</p>

<p>Mr. Poole made an experiment in the
upper gallery of a library, and found that&mdash;</p>

<p>'While the temperature of the floor was
65&deg; Fahr., that of the upper gallery was found
to be 142&deg;. Such a temperature dries up the
oil of the leather, and burns out its life. Books
cannot live where men cannot live.' Similarly,
Mr. Blades wrote in his little manual:</p>

<p>'The surest way to preserve your books
is to treat them as you would your own
children, who are sure to sicken if confined in
an atmosphere which is impure, too hot, too
cold, too damp, or too dry. It is just the
same with the progeny of literature.'</p>

<p>In London particularly dust, smoke, and
soot get at books and do great damage. To
have the top edges gilded is an excellent way
to prevent dust getting into the leaves. Books
which have roughly trimmed tops harbour dust
much more readily, and it is with great difficulty
removed from such. If a book is very dusty,
a small brush is perhaps the best means
to adopt to remove the offending particles.
Books should not be either swung together<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><a href="images/20.png">[20]</a></span>
or beaten together. The carpet in a library
should not reach to the wall, or right to the
cases, but should fall short so as to be removed
when required to be cleaned. A librarian at
Bath gives the following advice:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Our books are taken down once a year, in
the month of August, to be dusted, and, for the
last four or five years, I have adopted a simple
plan. When the books are well dusted I take
about half an ounce of the best horn glue,
and, having dissolved it in the usual way, I
add to it about a pint of warm water and a
teaspoonful of glycerine, and stir it well. Then
dipping a soft sponge into the solution, I wash
over the backs of the books. If the leather
is much perished or decayed, it will unduly
absorb the size, and a second touch over may
be necessary. The glycerine will have the
effect of preventing the glue from drying too
hard or stiffening the leather. When dry, the
books may be rubbed over with a chamois
leather. The above process, I find, helps to
nourish the leather, and to restore that property
which the heated air has destroyed. It
also freshens up and greatly improves the
appearance of the volumes upon the shelves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a><a href="images/21.png">[21]</a></span>
The operation must be repeated once a year
at least.'</p>

<p>Bottles of preparation are sold ready made
up for this purpose. Mr. Blades warmly echoed
the sentiment that housemaids and helps are
seldom bibliophiles, and, if, peradventure, one
Eve in a family can be indoctrinated with
book reverence, there may be salvation for all
the books. Mr. Blades himself had a fine
library, and goes fully into the subject of the
period of dusting and its methods.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>'Books <i>must</i> now and then be taken down
out of their shelves, but they should be tended
lovingly and with judgment. If the dusting
can be done just outside the room, so much
the better. The books removed, the shelf
should be lifted quite out of its bearings,
cleansed, and wiped, and then each volume
should be taken separately and gently rubbed on
back and edges with a soft cloth. In returning
the volumes to their places, notice should
be taken of the binding, and especially when
the books are in whole calf or morocco, care
should be taken not to let them rub together.
The best-bound books are soonest injured, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a><a href="images/22.png">[22]</a></span>
generally deteriorate in bad company. Certain
volumes, indeed, have evil tempers, and will
scratch the faces of all their neighbours who
are too familiar with them. Such are books
with metal clasps and rivets on their edges;
and such, again, are those abominable old
rascals, chiefly born in the fifteenth century,
who are proud of being dressed in real boards
with brass corners, and pass their lives with
fearful knobs and metal bosses.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When
your books are being dusted, don't impute too
much common sense to your assistants&mdash;take
their ignorance for granted.'</p>

<p>Mr. Blades then points out certain dangers
which beset the inexperienced handler of books.
Never lift a book by one of its corners. Do
not pile books up too high. Be careful not to
rub the dust <i>into</i> instead of <i>off</i> the edges. If
mildew or damp is discovered, carefully wipe it
away, and let the book stand open for some
days in a very dry spot&mdash;but not in front of a
fire. Be careful that no grit is on the duster,
or it will surely mark your books. Do not
wedge books in too tightly. Common-sense
must dictate what is right, but every volume
should <i>fit easily</i> in its place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a><a href="images/23.png">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Children and servants are not to be classed
as friendly to books, but little lapses on their
part are much more easily tolerated than the ignorance
of the person who ought to know better.
Such people insist upon having their books
bound in hideous bindings, and mutilated almost
beyond recognition by the bookbinder's plough.</p>

<p>I will talk about bookbinding later, but this
I will say, that in no way can a book be easier
ruined than by being placed unconditionally
in the hands of a bookbinder.</p>

<p>It is frequently supposed that the insect,
known as the bookworm, is a great enemy to
books. 'Tis true where the bookworm exists
it does irreparable damage, but fortunately it
is not an insect which may be found every
day. In America, they have, I believe, greater
trouble from these boring insects. They have
'fish bugs,' 'silver fish,' and 'bustle tails,' scientifically
known as <i>Lepisma Saccharina</i>. Another
is known as 'Buffalo Bug,' or 'Carpet Bug,' or
the <i>Anthrenus varius</i> of scientists. A third is
<i>Blatta Australasia</i>, a species of cockroach.</p>

<p>The following maxims may be learned by
heart, or if preferred, they can be bought by
experience:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a><a href="images/24.png">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Do not bite your paper knife until it has the
edge of a saw.</p>

<p>Do not cut books except with a proper ivory
paper knife.</p>

<p>It is ruination to a good book not to cut it
right through into the corners.</p>

<p>Do not turn the leaves of books down.
Particularly, do not turn down the leaves of
books printed on plate paper.</p>

<p>If you are in the habit of lending books, do
not mark them. These two habits together
constitute an act of indiscretion.</p>

<p>It is better to give a book than to lend it.</p>

<p>Never write upon a title-page or half-title.
The blank fly-leaf is the right place.</p>

<p>Books are neither card-racks, crumb-baskets,
or receptacles for dead leaves.</p>

<p>Books were not meant as cushions, nor were
they meant to be toasted before a fire.</p>

<p>Valets and maids appear to take kindly to
the packing of everything except books. I
will therefore say that only small quantities
(twelve volumes to twenty) should be packed
in a parcel. Boxes, either wine-cases, or
boxes specially made, should be used. Books
being very solid and heavy should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a><a href="images/25.png">[25]</a></span>
packed in strong cases, and the method
of packing them should be to place them
upright alternately on back and edge in
layers. By this means they can be fitted
tightly to the case they are meant to travel
in. Leather bound volumes should be wrapped
up singly before being packed, and the box
should be carefully lined with paper so that any
roughness on the wood of the box may not
damage the volumes.</p>

<p>Book and parcel post volumes should have
three or four thicknesses of paper, and if bound
volumes a strawboard on either side as well as
paper.</p>




<h2><span class='u'><i>The Art of Reading.</i></span></h2>


<p>First, how to read. The reason why
so many people who read much know
so little, is because they read isolated books
instead of reading one book in connexion
with another. The memory is trained by
association, and if you read two books
in succession on one subject you know
more than twice as much as if you had
read one book only. A good memory is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><a href="images/26.png">[26]</a></span>
memory which assimilates. Every one has a
good memory for something. A good memory
rejects and sifts, and does not accept everything
offered to it like a pillar-box. Do not
join reading societies, because they kill individuality.
Choose your subject, and work all
round it. There is an extensive literature on
the subject of 'The Art of Reading,' 'The
Best Hundred Books,' &amp;c. Most of it is useless
and bewildering. The best advice I
have ever seen in print about reading was by
Sir Herbert Maxwell, and it appeared some
years ago at the end of a <i>Nineteenth Century</i>
article. It is as follows:</p>

<p>'If any young person of leisure were so
much at a loss as to ask advice as to
what he should read, mine should be exceedingly
simple&mdash;<i>Read anything</i> bearing on a
definite object. Let him take up any imaginable
subject to which he feels attracted, be
it the precession of the equinoxes or postage
stamps, the Athenian drama or London street
cries; let him follow it from book to book,
and unconsciously his knowledge, not of that
subject only, but of many subjects, will be
increased, for the departments of the realm of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a><a href="images/27.png">[27]</a></span>
knowledge are divided by no <i>octroi</i>. He may
abandon the first object of his pursuit for
another; it does not matter, one subject leads
to another; he will have acquired the habit of
acquisition; he will have gained that conviction
of the pricelessness of time which
makes it intolerable for a man to lie abed of
a morning.'</p>

<p>The art of reading is a thing to learn,
and with it comes the equally valuable art of
skipping.</p>

<p>Mr. Balfour's advice to readers is to learn
the arts of skipping and skimming, and the
late Philip Gilbert Hamerton said:&mdash;'The
art of reading is to skip judiciously. The art
is to skip all that does not concern us, whilst
missing nothing that we really need. No
external guidance can teach this; for nobody
but ourselves can guess what the needs of our
intellect may be.'</p>

<p>No one knows how to skim and skip who
has not first well threshed out some subject
for himself. No one can tear the heart out
of a book who has not first been through the
student period. Advice is poured forth in
lengthy magazine articles, and lectures, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a><a href="images/28.png">[28]</a></span>
as far as I know there is nothing which
embodies such good sense on this subject,
excepting Sir Herbert Maxwell's advice above,
as a tiny pamphlet, about two inches square,
written by Miss Lucy Soulsby, and sold for
twopence. It is rather absurdly called <i>Things
in Books Clothing!</i></p>

<p>Below are printed only such passages,
gathered from many sources, as I think are
necessary to be known about the art of reading.</p>

<p>'It is true that the most absolute master of
his own hours still needs thrift if he would turn
them to account, and that too many <i>never</i> learn
this thrift, whilst others learn it late.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Few intellectual men have the art of economising
the hours of study. The very necessity
which every one acknowledges of giving
vast portions of life to attain proficiency in
anything, makes us prodigal where we ought
to be parsimonious, and careless where we
have need of unceasing vigilance. The best
time-savers are a love of soundness in all we
learn or do, and a cheerful acceptance of
inevitable limitations.'<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>'In exchange for the varied pleasures of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><a href="images/29.png">[29]</a></span>
fashionable life, the intellectual life can offer
you but one satisfaction, for all its promises are
reducible simply to this, that you shall come at
last, after infinite labour, into contact with some
great <i>reality;</i> that you shall know and do in
such sort that you will feel yourself on firm
ground, and be recognised&mdash;probably not much
applauded, but yet recognised&mdash;as a fellow-labourer
by other knowers and doers. Before
you come to this, most of your present accomplishments
will be abandoned by yourself
as unsatisfactory and insufficient, but one or
two of them will be turned to better account,
and will give you, after many years, a tranquil
self-respect, and, what is still rarer and better,
a very deep and earnest reverence for the
greatness which is above you. Severed from
the vanities of the illusory, you will live with
the realities of knowledge as one who has
quitted the painted scenery of the theatre to
listen by the eternal ocean or gaze at the
granite hills.'<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>'Reading, with me, incites to reflection instantly.
I cannot separate the origination of
ideas from the reception of ideas. The consequence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a><a href="images/30.png">[30]</a></span>
is, as I read I always begin to think in
various directions, and that makes my reading
slow.'<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>'When a particular object has to be attained,
reading cannot be too special. There is an
enormous waste of intelligence through a
neglect of this fact, but otherwise reading
should "come by nature." When I look
through the list of The Best Hundred Books,
I cannot help saying to myself, "Here are the
most admirable and varied materials for the
formation of a prig."'<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>'Let us not be afraid of using a dictionary.
<i>A</i> dictionary? A dozen; at all events, until
Dr. Murray's huge undertaking is finished.
And even then, for no one dictionary will help
us through some authors&mdash;say, Chaucer, or
Spenser, or Sir Thomas Browne. Let us use
our full lexicon, and Latin dictionary, and
French dictionary, and Anglo-Saxon dictionary,
and etymological dictionary, and dictionaries of
antiquity, and biography, and geography, and
concordances, anything and everything that
will throw light on the meanings and histories of
words.'<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

way is to write an essay in refutation of

some recent hebdomadal animadversions upon

founded, this is questionable. The worst way,

making himself master of some subject
which he was studying, and that while he
was so engaged he made all his reading converge
to that point. In this way he might
read parts of many books, but not a single one
from "end to end." This I take to be an
excellent method of study, but one which
implies the command of many books.'<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

striking, beautiful, or important passages is a
tremendous aid to the memory; these will live
for years, clear and vivid as day, when the

<p>Next in importance is what to read. Be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><a href="images/33.png">[33]</a></span>
very careful about reading books which are
recommended, because they are books of the
hour. Fools step in and say read this and that
without thinking to put themselves in your
place. Because a book suits one person, it is
only a rare chance that it will suit a friend
equally.</p>

<p>Before recommending a book to another
with assurance, you must know the book well,
and the friend to whom it is recommended
you must know much better. Read the book
which suggests something responsive and
sympathetic. No one can tell you this as
well as you can find it for yourself. Practice
will teach you to choose a book, as practice has
taught you to choose a friend. You will almost
be able to choose it in the dark. There are
affinities for books as for people, but this does
not come at once.</p>

<p>The proper appreciation of the great books
of the world is the reward of lifelong study.
You must work up to them, and unconsciously
you will become trained to find great qualities
in what the world has decided is great. Novel
reading is not a part of the intellectual life, it is
a part of the fashionable life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><a href="images/34.png">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Lamb says that Bridget Elia 'was tumbled
early, by accident or design, into a spacious
library of good old English reading, without
much selection or prohibition, and browsed at
will upon that fair and wholesome pasturage.'
And he adds, 'Had I twenty girls they should
be brought up exactly in this fashion.'</p>

<p>Ruskin says, 'there need be no choosing at
all. Keep the modern magazine and novel out
of your girl's way; turn her loose into the
old library every wet day, and let her alone.
She will find out what is good for her.'</p>

<p>Mr. Ruskin notwithstanding, there will ever
be a large public who will read nothing unless
it has a story in it.</p>

<p>Nearly all readers of books may be divided
into two classes, those who read as students
towards some definite end, and those who read
for amusement. The latter class are greatly
in the majority, and I have no hesitation in
saying that a love of fiction will always predominate
over a love of research, even in its
light form. The student class, among whom
are many critics, usually fail to understand the
position of the fiction lovers, with the result
that the fiction readers and fiction itself get a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a><a href="images/35.png">[35]</a></span>
great many jibes and taunts. To open this
question would involve a long argument, and
would bring about no good. All experience
goes to prove that a very large section of the
public, not being students, loves to read the
books of the hour, and great pleasure may be
got therefrom. The smaller section, trained to
different habits, and regarding books in a more
serious light, put their collection of books to
different purposes, and, I know, get great
pleasure therefrom. The two classes can run
parallel together, and one class should not
try to exterminate the other.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> In country
houses the books in billiard-rooms and in the
bedrooms should appropriately be fiction. Not
many guests at a house-party are in the frame
of mind to take up serious books, nor are
there the opportunities given for application
which such would require. I think where the
general house library is (as is very often the
case) not a living room, there is then much more
reason for separating fiction and light literature,
and placing them in a very accessible position.
It will often be found advisable, as fiction accumulates,
to weed out and decide what volumes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a><a href="images/36.png">[36]</a></span>
shall be bound and what rejected or placed in
the servants' library. Shelves should therefore
be reserved for books which are thus
going through a period of probation.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>A fiction library may be made very interesting
if it is so arranged as to represent
the history of France or of England, or any
country. From the boundless stores of fiction
writers&mdash;in fact, from Scott alone almost&mdash;a
sequence of volumes may be arranged which,
if read in proper order, would make a very
excellent romance history. Almost every interesting
episode of history has had its story
woven into romance. Thus there are, I believe,
about eighteen historical romances relating to
the Monmouth rebellion alone.</p>

<p>'Much of love,' said Lord Bowen, 'has only
been learned under the instruction of some
woman who has herself only learned it from a
book. Authoresses, indeed, have not unfrequently
betrayed the key to some of their sex's
secrets. Were it not for <i>Northanger Abbey</i> and
Miss Austen, some of the old mysteries of girlish
friendship would have remained untold, and we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a><a href="images/37.png">[37]</a></span>
should never have known or understood the
curiosity which may lurk in a refined bosom at
seventeen. Man would scarcely have guessed
but for <i>Jane Eyre</i> the impression which can be
made, it seems, upon a heart by a middle-aged
gentleman with the manners of a bear and the
composure of a prig. Furthermore, it is
through women's novels that we have had
brought home to us most adequately what
women who have tasted it, or seen it, can best
relate, the despicable egotism of a weak man.
Anzoleto in <i>Consuelo</i>, Tito in <i>Romola</i>.'<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>It is important for every one to fix upon a
time for everyday study, and remember to
read when you have a disposition so to
do. Do not think that spare moments not
spent in reading are lost. Some spare time
must be kept for thinking. If you have
'nerves,' it is no good to read then; read when
the mind is quiet and receptive. This will
probably be when dressing in the morning, or
at night before going to bed. Keep a small
bookcase in your dressing-room; in so doing
you will learn the art of going to bed well.
Read at any time when curiosity is aroused as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><a href="images/38.png">[38]</a></span>
to any person, place, or subject, and keep
reference books at hand to answer questions
intelligently. Napoleon read all the new
novels in a travelling carriage, and pitched
them out of the window as each was finished.
Active minds, to read advantageously, should
seek a quiet <i>sanctum</i> of their own.</p>

<p>A very admirable suggestion was made a
short time since, I think by Dr. Ernest Hart,
that it should be more a custom to have bookcases
in bedrooms. Many persons, and, I
believe, notably Mr. Gladstone, read before
going to bed. I think all bedrooms should
have a selection of favourite books, and I do
not think that novels are nearly so suitable
as books of short essays and sketches. Few
people would sit up sufficiently long to read a
novel through, and many would therefore not
begin what they knew they would be unable
to finish.</p>




<h2><span class="u"><i>Common-place Books.</i></span></h2>


<p>Very numerous methods have been suggested
whereby memory may be assisted and
the assimilation of our reading proceed without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a><a href="images/39.png">[39]</a></span>
indigestion. A reader is often pictured with
note-book in hand, supposed to be memorising
what he is reading. There is no doubt that
note-books are very useful, but no note-book or
commonplace-book should take the place of the
natural memory&mdash;and every one has a good
memory for something.</p>

<p>Thomas Fuller has wittily said, 'Adventure
not all thy learning in one bottom, but divide it
between thy memory and thy note-books.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
A commonplace-book contains many notions in
garrison, whence an owner may draw out an
army into the field on competent warning.'</p>

<p>Every one has his and her own way of
keeping a commonplace-book. Mr. Sala, I
remember, once gave a minute account of his
jottings in this way:<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> 'Todd's <i>Index Rerum</i> was,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a><a href="images/40.png">[40]</a></span>
in its day, very little else than an alphabeted
book&mdash;a forerunner of what stationers now sell
in various sizes called <i>Where is it?</i> The
simplest form of commonplace-book is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a><a href="images/41.png">[41]</a></span>
plain quarto MS. book ruled in an ordinary
way, and in this entries may be made without
being alphabeted. Do not write extracts
or notes right across the line, but make your
entries thus, having the keyword clear and
easy to be seen:&mdash;</p>

<div class="hang1">'PICUS DE MIRANDOLA.&mdash;His extraordinary
gifts. His being sought after
by women. Compare with H. T. Buckle.
See also Hallam's <i>Literary History</i>,
Part I. chap. iii.</div>

<p>In the matter of note-books, I am sure that
it is best for every one to make notes in the
way best suited to his convenience. Many, I
think, find that taking notes while reading a
book is an undesirable interruption. To such,
it may be suggested to have slips of paper
about half an inch wide, and four or five inches
long, and insert these at the pages which contain
anything notable. Then, when the book
is finished, go through and transcribe or
memorise such passages as are thus marked.
I think it a great mistake to attempt too rigid
a system in note-books, or too much red tape of
any kind, because whenever this is done, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a><a href="images/42.png">[42]</a></span>
time and thought, which should be given to the
matter of the extract helping to fix it upon the
memory, is given instead to the secondary
matter of keeping your note-books very neat.</p>




<h2><span class="u"><i>Reference Books.</i></span></h2>


<p>I have been very often asked for a book
which will 'tell one everything.' There is no
such book, and there never could be such a
book. Omniscience may be a foible of men,
but it is not so of books. Knowledge, as
Johnson said, is of two kinds, you may know a
thing yourself, and you may know where to find
it.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Now the amount which you may actually
know yourself must, at its best, be limited,
but what you may know of the sources of
information may, with proper training, become
almost boundless. And here come the value
and use of reference books&mdash;the working of one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a><a href="images/43.png">[43]</a></span>
book in connexion with another&mdash;and applying
your own intelligence to both. By this means we
get as near to that omniscient volume which tells
everything as ever we shall get, and although
the single volume or work which tells everything
does not exist, there is a vast number of
reference books in existence, a knowledge and
proper use of which is essential to every intelligent
person. Necessary as I believe reference
books to be, they can easily be made to be
contributory to idleness, and too mechanical a
use should not be made of them. Very
admirable reference books come to us from
America, where great industry is shown, and
funds for publishing them never seem to be
short. The French, too, are excellent at
reference books, but the inferior way in which
they are printed makes them tiresome to
refer to. Larousse's <i>Grand Dictionnaire</i> is
a miracle.</p>

<p>A good atlas is essential as a reference
book, and maps of the locality where we live.
A good map of old London is very useful in
studying <i>Pepys' Diary</i> for instance. A good
verbal dictionary is essential. Sometimes
several should be in use: thus, Halliwell's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a><a href="images/44.png">[44]</a></span>
<i>Archaic Dictionary</i> and Nares' <i>Glossary</i> are
useful in studying Shakespeare. Richardson's
<i>Dictionary</i> embodies all the good points of
Johnson's <i>Dictionary</i>, and is very excellent
for quotations. Poetical <i>Concordances</i> and
<i>Dictionaries of Quotations</i>, both prose and
poetry, are useful, though very rarely does
one find the quotation required in any professed
book of quotations. A good <i>Biographical
Dictionary</i> is a joy; such is Lippincott's, an
American work. A good <i>Classical Dictionary</i>
is also necessary, and may be supplemented by
Smith's <i>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography</i>.
It would be interesting to see how
far it would be possible to collect an ideal
reference library, and this, I think, has never
been carefully done. It must be borne in mind
that reference books are not all books arranged
alphabetically (though the man who first wrote
an alphabeted book should be Canonised).
Reference books consist of such works as
Rawlinson's Historical Works, Wilkinson's
<i>History of the Ancient Egyptians</i>, and Fergusson's
<i>History of Architecture</i>. All such books
are reference books, and many thousands more.
I think it will be found a good plan in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a><a href="images/45.png">[45]</a></span>
library to keep reference books (viz., those
which are likely to be in frequent use) in a
separate case&mdash;perhaps a revolving case&mdash;and
in no library should this section be neglected.
Mr. Walter Wren, the well-known coach, once
lectured on 'What is Education?' and in his
lecture he made the following remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p>'I think the first thing that made me a
teacher was my noticing, when a boy, how
men and women read books and papers, and
knew no more about them when they had read
them than they did before.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Lots of
people seem to know nothing, and to want
to know nothing; at any rate, they never
show any wish to learn anything. I
was once in a room where not one person
could say where Droitwich was; once, at a
dinner of fourteen, where only one besides
myself knew in what county Salisbury was. I
have asked, I believe, over a hundred times
where Stilton is, and have been told twice&mdash;this
when Stilton cheese was handed. I
mention this to show the peculiar conservative
mental apathy of Englishmen.'</p>

<p>'A reader should be familiar with the best
method by which the original investigation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a><a href="images/46.png">[46]</a></span>
any topic may be carried on. When he has
found it, he appreciates, perhaps for the first
time, for what purpose books are for, and how
to use them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No person has any claim
to be a scholar until he can conduct such an
original investigation with ease and pleasure.'
The foregoing was the advice of a well-known
American librarian.</p>




<h2><span class="u"><i>Boudoir Libraries.</i></span></h2>


<p>Women have their own way of loving
books. They are very rarely students, and
more rarely still do they amass really
great libraries, though many of the famous
women of history have done so. Yet a
woman likes to have her own books, and she
likes, too, to have them separate from her
husband's or her brothers', or the general
family collection. Most women like tiny editions
fitted into tiny cases.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Colour is much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a><a href="images/47.png">[47]</a></span>
more to a woman than to a man, and in the
binding of her books she will very often be
very happily inspired. I think that it is in
De Maistre's <i>Journey Round my Room</i> that he
says, 'It is certain that colours exercise an
influence over us to the extent of rendering
us gay or sad, according to their shades.'
Charming tiny bookcases are now sold in
various woods and in all sizes, and these have
the advantage of being easily moved from
place to place. A very pretty effect can be
produced by a book-screen, but this, to be of
service for taking books, must be placed in
a room larger than most boudoirs. In choosing
bindings for small books do not be surprised
if, when bound, your books are not as flexible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a><a href="images/48.png">[48]</a></span>
as they should be. The easy opening of a
book, and this particularly applies to small
books, depends very much upon the thickness
of the paper used, and small books printed on
thick paper will never open well. Much
blame is often heaped upon binders in this
direction which is by no means their fault.
Roan, parchment, vellum, morocco, and buckram
are all suitable for boudoir bindings. Very
pretty effects are produced by binding a series
of small books in vellum with green lettering-pieces,
and green edges instead of gilded edges.
White backs, with pink or blue lettering-pieces,
are also very dainty; and a pretty
effect of another kind is produced by dark
brown polished calf, with round backs, raised
bands, and yellow edges.</p>

<p>Reference books, such as verbal dictionaries,
dictionaries of quotations, a classical dictionary,
an atlas, or a biographical dictionary, should
always be to hand; and even when these are
in the large library, duplicates should be kept
in the boudoir.</p>

<p>In a very charming book, already referred
to, called <i>The Story of my House</i>, there is
certain practical advice which seems to be the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a><a href="images/49.png">[49]</a></span>
result of much experience and excellent taste
on the part of the writer.</p>

<p>'With regard to the bookcases themselves,
their height should depend upon that of the
ceilings, and the number of one's volumes.
For classification and reference it is more convenient
to have numerous small cases of similar
or nearly similar size, and the same general
style of construction, than a few large cases
in which everything is engulphed. With small
or medium-sized receptacles, each one may contain
volumes relating to certain departments or
different languages, as the case may be; by
this means a volume and its kindred may be
readily found.'</p>

<p>'The style and colour of the bindings,
also, may subserve a similar purpose; as, for
instance, the poets in yellow or orange, books
on nature in olive, the philosophers in blue,
the French classics in red, &amp;c. Unless
methodically arranged, even with a very small
library, a volume is often difficult to turn to
when desired for immediate consultation, requiring
tedious search, especially if the volumes
are arranged upon the shelves with respect
to size and outward symmetry. This may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a><a href="images/50.png">[50]</a></span>
avoided by the use of small bookcases and a
definite style of binding.'</p>

<p>I think here that the boudoir library
should have its own catalogue, and every
bookshelf marked or numbered. Every boudoir
library should have a catalogue.</p>

<p>'In a room ten and a half to eleven feet
high, five feet is a desirable height for the
bookcases. Besides the drawers at the base,
this will afford space for four rows of books,
to include octavos, duodecimos, and smaller
volumes. The shelves should, of course, be
shifting.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. By leaving the top of the
bookcase twelve to thirteen inches wide, ample
space will be allowed for additional small
books, porcelain, and <i>bric-&agrave;-brac</i>. It must be
borne in mind that tall bookcases, in addition
to the inaccessibility of the volumes in the
upper shelves, have little, if any, space for
pictures on the walls above them.'</p>

<p>It may be appropriate here to remind
readers of an essay in Addison's <i>Spectator</i>
upon my Lady's Library.</p>

<p>'Some months ago, my Friend, Sir Roger,
being in the Country, enclosed a Letter to
me, directed to a certain Lady, whom I shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a><a href="images/51.png">[51]</a></span>
here call by the name of <i>Leonora</i>, and as it
contained Matters of Consequence, desired me
to deliver it to her with my own Hand.
Accordingly, I waited upon her Ladyship
early in the Morning, and was desired by
her Woman to walk into her Lady's Library till
such time as she was in Readiness to receive
me. The very Sound of a <i>Lady's Library</i> gave
me a great Curiosity to see it; and as it was
some time before the Lady came to me, I had
an Opportunity of turning over a great many
of her Books, which were ranged together in
very beautiful Order. At the end of the <i>Folios</i>
(which were finely bound and gilt) were great
Jars of <i>China</i>, placed one above another in a
very noble piece of Architecture. The <i>Quartos</i>
were separated from the <i>Octavos</i> by a Pile of
smaller Vessels, which rose in a delightful
Pyramid. The <i>Octavos</i> were bounded by Tea
Dishes of all Shapes, Colours, and Sizes, which
were so disposed on a wooden Frame that
they looked like one continued Pillar indented
with the finest Strokes of Sculpture, and stained
with the greatest Variety of Dyes. That Part
of the Library which was designed for the
Reception of Plays and Pamphlets and other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><a href="images/52.png">[52]</a></span>
loose Papers, was enclosed in a kind of Square,
consisting of one of the prettiest Grotesque
Works that ever I saw, and made up of Scaramouches,
Lions, Monkies, Mandarines, Trees,
Shells, and a thousand other odd Figures in
<i>China</i> Ware. In the midst of the Room was
a little Japan Table, with a Quire of gilt Paper
upon it, and on the Paper a Silver Snuff-box,
made in the Shape of a little Book. I found
there were several other Counterfeit Books
upon the upper Shelves, which were carved in
Wood, and served only to fill up the Number,
like Fagots in the muster of a Regiment. I
was wonderfully pleased with such a mixt
kind of Furniture, as seemed very suitable both
to the Lady and the Scholar, and did not know
at first whether I should fancy myself in a
Grotto, or in a Library.'</p>




<h2><span class="u"><i>Bookbinding.</i></span></h2>


<p>As far as I am aware there are only four
bookbinders in London who may be trusted
not to mutilate a book, and there are only
two who have any sense of design and harmony
of colour. In sending a book to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a><a href="images/53.png">[53]</a></span>
bound, if you value the book, you cannot be
too careful or minute in giving instructions as
to your wishes.</p>

<p>I think the best way to assist by advice is
to picture a number of everyday instances of
people requiring books to be bound, and to
take such familiar cases instancing well-known
books and show how each case can best be
dealt with.</p>

<p>First of all, the right leather to use for
binding is morocco. This is best; more durable,
and a better choice of colour is given you.
Half-morocco is good, but see that you get
a good wide strip of morocco, and that it is
not all cloth sides with a very narrow spine
of leather. Valuable books should never be
cut down. In many cases the top edges
may be gilded which is a preservative from
dust, but there are many other cases where
instructions should be given to 'gild on the
rough,' the three other sides should be left
alone.</p>

<p>I will first take the case of the 'Cambridge'
<i>Shakespeare</i>, the hand-made paper edition,
already spoken of, where each play has been
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads ' ssued'">issued</ins> in a separate volume, and in all forty thin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a><a href="images/54.png">[54]</a></span>
volumes. Now the first question to settle is:
Shall I have each of the forty volumes bound
separately, or shall I bind the forty in twenty
double volumes? or another question may arise
in your mind, Shall I keep the book in its neat
linen cover as published, and get another
small paper copy, and bind that instead? Such
questions must be settled&mdash;each one for himself.
All I will say now is that the large
paper forty volume edition when bound in
twenty double volumes makes a very ideal copy
of a great English classic; so, presuming that it
is to be bound, you must choose the style of
binding. It should rest between half-morocco
and whole morocco, the latter costing about
double the former. I think half-morocco is
right for the book in most cases, whole morocco
being unnecessarily expensive. Then comes
colour, which must largely be referred to your
own taste&mdash;olive-green, brown, dark red, and
light apple green, would all be appropriate
colours to choose from. The binder should have
a book of colours and shades ready for you
to select one from. Be sure and see that
you have a coarse-grained levant morocco,
which is much handsomer than the less good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a><a href="images/55.png">[55]</a></span>
hard fine-grained morocco; of course it should
be a polished or crushed levant binding,
though when you see the pattern piece
of leather it will be rough and unpolished.
At any rate select a colour which, when
polished, will work '<i>clean</i>.' Do not select
anything <i>very light</i> in morocco, it will probably
not work 'clean,' but come out spotted
even when new.</p>

<p>You will now select 'end papers.' These, I
am sorry to say, are mostly very ugly, though
there have recently been made some beautiful
cloudy coloured papers, which now and then,
and apparently by accident, are very beautiful,
and they are also rather expensive. Some of
the Japanese papers have pretty and very unobtrusive
marblings worked upon them, and
occasionally, too, a brocade paper looks well;
but for a classic, the plainer the better, and very
often a monotint end paper, or even a plain white,
looks exceedingly well. In the matter of end
and side papers, it is as well to know that these
can very easily be altered even after the book
is finished. The revival of flat backs has been
the cause of some disputing. I think myself
that the pleasure with which the trained eye<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a><a href="images/56.png">[56]</a></span>
regards the flat back is sufficient excuse for it.
As far as technique goes, the flat back is, I
believe, just as lasting and as flexible as the
round. Much must however be determined by
the size and shape of the book as to whether a
flat back is adopted or not. The <i>Shakespeare</i>
which is now under consideration, when <i>bound
in double volumes</i>, would, I think, look well with
a flat back, and with flat raised bands between
the panels; whereas, when bound in forty
single volumes, it would be better to have a
round back.</p>

<p>As to decoration and finish, the most lamentable
errors of taste are often committed.
Over-adornment is a curse. A person sees an
attractive pattern lying in a shop, and wants
all his or her books bound like it, without for a
moment considering the anachronisms and impossible
combinations that will thereby be perpetrated.
It is the same with clothes. A man
sees another man with a fine coat, and he
straightway thinks he, too, will have a coat of
that same make and pattern. Never does it
occur to him to gauge the stature or character
of the man who was first wearing the coat.
There is yet a good deal of the monkey and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a><a href="images/57.png">[57]</a></span>
the ape left in us. We seem to do our best to
stifle our individuality, and reduce our souls to
one sad dead level of accursed and wicked
imitation. Some day we shall have our eyes
opened, and then see that a man may break
the whole of the Ten Commandments at once,
and yet he shall be saved if he be not vulgar,
and it is both senseless and vulgar to copy old
bindings on to modern books. The only decoration
which the copy of Shakespeare could
require is a gilt line, or double gilt lines, round
the panels of the back. The full gilt back is
fortunately becoming extinct. It may well die.</p>

<p>Decoration of books should only be carried
out when we are sure we have an appropriate
design, and when we are sure that the book is
worth it.</p>

<p>There are now some other details to be
looked after. I refuse to class them as minor
details, because towards the making of the
perfect book everything right is <i>essential</i>.</p>

<p>(1) The <i>Shakespeare</i>, being a book printed
on paper of good quality, should have the top
edge gilt, but the other sides should be left
untouched or very slightly trimmed. (2) There
should be one or two markers in each volume,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a><a href="images/58.png">[58]</a></span>
and the colour of these markers should harmonise
with the colour of the binding. (3)
The lettering should be chosen yourself. There
should be a principal title <i>stamped boldly and
deeply</i>, and subordinate lettering stamped lower
down and in smaller type. Thus <small>SHAKESPEARE'S WORKS</small> or <small>SHAKESPEARE</small> merely in the top panel,
with the editor's name underneath, and then
below should be lettered the plays contained in
each volume, and below that, at the foot, the
date of publication. (4) Three weeks to a
month at least should be allowed for the
binding of such a work. (5) A folded copy
in quires of a book is always preferable to a
cloth-bound copy. (6) If a binder should ever
suggest either a padded binding, a russia
leather binding, or a tree calf binding, you
may instantly leave his premises, for he cannot
understand his business.</p>

<p>It will be understood that the rules which
apply to the binding of this Shakespeare
equally apply to most other books. I propose,
however, to take such instances as I think
present difficulties not already met, and see
how they can be overcome.</p>

<p>A second instance shall be the new edition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a><a href="images/59.png">[59]</a></span>
of <i>Pepys' Diary</i>. The fact that this, and many
other books, are published volume by volume
makes it somewhat difficult to know whether to
bind them at once or not to do so. In the case
of the new edition of <i>Pepys' Diary</i>, as neither
the binding of the large or small paper is unsightly,
it should be left until complete, one
good reason for this being that, if it be bound
volume by volume as published, the binder
will require a pattern volume each time, and
your pattern volume will be lying about his
workshop each time a volume is published.
To register a pattern is by no means advisable in
the case of a really well-bound series of books.
It may do well enough for scientific and other
journals, when great nicety of detail is not
so much required. In the case of well-bound
volumes, a pattern should accompany the order.
A book like <i>Murray's Dictionary</i>, volumes of
which are slow in completing themselves, the
parts of the volumes, current and incomplete,
should either be tied up in paper, and kept
together, or they should be placed between two
pieces of millboard on the shelf where they will
finally be placed.</p>

<p>A third instance shall be an old book which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a><a href="images/60.png">[60]</a></span>
requires repairing or restoring. We will suppose
that it is an old copy of <i>Clarissa Harlowe</i>,
which you have picked up on a country book-stall.
Now the binding is probably very much
broken, and, being very dry, is getting rapidly
worse. It is time, therefore, that it went into
hospital, and at the bookbinder's hospital very
clever operations are performed. To restore a
binding, paste is rubbed over the leather, and,
after it is dry, it is washed over with a thin
solution of glue size. Again, when dry, the
volume is varnished and afterwards rubbed
over with a cloth upon which a few drops of
sweet oil have been dropped. Here is one
operation just in outline. There are very
many others, which I can only refer to. If
there are ink marks on any of the volumes of
your <i>Clarissa</i>, which you wish removed, this
can probably be done so that no trace is left.
Similarly many grease-spots can be effectually
removed. If a page is torn, it can be repaired,
or if a piece of it is missing, it can be
facsimiled, and the whole of the inside of the
volume can be washed throughout. Never
destroy an old binding if you can help it, and
never obliterate marks of ownership, for it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><a href="images/61.png">[61]</a></span>
interesting to trace the owners of a book. If
a bookplate is in your <i>Clarissa</i>, and you wish
your own to appear, transplant the former one
to the end cover, and put your own in the front
if you wish. Never have such a book as we
are now discussing cut down. A book has
recently been written and published by Mr.
C. G. Leland on <i>Mending and Repairing</i>, in
which the author recommends the amateur to
repair his own books. I believe Mr. Leland is
an expert hand at many arts and crafts, but I
do not think that every amateur should attempt
experiments in repairing his own books unless
he means to give a great deal of time to it,
which very few would, I think, care to do.</p>

<p>The following remarks, taken from a review,
I think by Mr. A. Lang, are valuable:&mdash;'The
binder is often very mischievous. He
not only "cuts down" books, impairing their
shapeliness and ruining them for sale, nay,
even <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'cuttting'">cutting</ins> off lines, but he is apt to lose
fly-leaves, with imprints, and rare autographs.
What he rejects may have a merely fanciful
or sentimental interest, still that interest can
be expressed in terms of currency. An eighth
of an inch in margin may represent a large<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a><a href="images/62.png">[62]</a></span>
sum of money, and it is just as easy not to
cut down the volume. Old bookplates ought
to be kept, on new bindings of old books.
They are the pedigree of a volume. The
ancient covers, if discarded, should be examined.
They are often packed with fragments
of old manuscripts, deeds, woodcuts,
or engravings. The ages have handed books
on to us; it is our duty to hand them on to
coming generations, clean, sound, uninjured.'</p>

<p>The fourth case shall be paper-bound
novels, English and French editions, and
Tauchnitz copies. I have no hesitation in saying
that the best material is Buckram. It has the
merit of being good&mdash;that is to say, durable,
cheap, artistic, and not harsh to handle, as
many linens are. There are some half-a-dozen
good colours in Buckram, and these, when
relieved by lettering-pieces of some contrasting
colour, can be made most decorative and economical.
I believe buckram is in every way a
most excellent material for binding, and for
students who buy and use German and French
text-books published in paper, this material is
excellent for their libraries as well.</p>

<p>Here may be added a few words as to Pamphlets<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a><a href="images/63.png">[63]</a></span>
and Magazines. It has been recommended
that Pamphlets be kept in boxes, which
may be placed upon the shelves as books, but
this will not be found either convenient or secure.
The best way is to bind Pamphlets in volumes
according to size, or if <i>very</i> numerous, according
to date or subject, and let them each be
entered separately in the catalogue. In the
cataloguing of private libraries it is sometimes
thought that certain sections, such as pamphlets
and magazines, are not worth entering,
but the only safe rule is that, if it is worth
keeping, it is worth cataloguing. Single pamphlets
should be bound in limp roan, and
volumes of pamphlets in buckram or half-calf,
with full lettering on the back.</p>

<p>Magazines, when they are kept complete,
should, of course, be bound up in their volumes,
either yearly or half-yearly; but it often
happens that a magazine is bought for a
single article, and many of these accumulating,
it is quite easy for such articles as are of special
interest to be taken from the remainder, and
treated as pamphlets. In the case of magazines
and scientific periodicals of importance, it is well
to keep the covers and bind them at the end of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><a href="images/64.png">[64]</a></span>
each volume. Music should be bound in limp
roan in preference to limp calf, because the
latter would sooner show scratches and marks,
particularly as a large surface is exposed.</p>

<p>If you want your pamphlets and novels to
look nice, beware of your binder using what
he calls his odd pieces, generally monsters of
ugliness.</p>

<p>Family papers, autograph letters, and MS.
matter of all kinds should be placed in the
hands of an expert, with instructions to <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'callendar'">calendar</ins>
them, viz., catalogue them, giving a
<i>pr&eacute;cis</i> of the contents of each one. They
should then be mounted and bound up in
volumes, with abstract of contents in front of
the volume. It will be well to consider the
advisability of having typed copies made of
the whole wherever unpublished records exist.</p>

<p>Much, very much, more might be written
about practical details in bookbinding, but
nothing is so valuable as experience, and a few
mistakes will be the best teacher. Remember that
morocco is the best material, whether it be half or
whole morocco, pigskin is second, calf is third,
vellum is fourth, roan is fifth, buckram is sixth,
though it may frequently take the place of calf.</p>

<h2><span class="u"><i>Book Hobbies.</i></span></h2>


<p>It has been remarked that only an auctioneer
admires all schools of literature. I think it is
certain that the way to get most enjoyment
from books is to specialise a little. Mr. Pepys,
it will be remembered, collected Black Letter
Ballads, Penny Merriments, Penny Witticisms,
Penny Compliments, and Penny Godlinesses,
and what Pepys paid a penny for are now worth
much gold. Lord Crawford is, I believe, one
of the most enthusiastic among present day
collectors, and I am told that he spends many
hours in arranging and cataloguing his extensive
and curious collection. As far as I can gather
from the printed catalogues which have been
issued of Lord Crawford's library, he is rivalling
Pepys in his collection of ballads. Other subjects
which he has taken up are proclamations
and Papal bulls. I cannot omit saying that
if Lord Crawford's example were followed by
a few more rich men, they would find therein
very amusing hobbies. The catalogues of the
Ballads and the Proclamations in the Library
at Haigh Hall have been compiled by Lord<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a><a href="images/66.png">[66]</a></span>
Crawford's own hand, and there are no better
catalogues of a private collection in existence.
The late Lord Braybrooke collected County
histories, and got together a most valuable and
interesting collection. But, judging from his
own account of his collection,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> it was too
general to be very interesting. There is hardly
a more useful or profitable book hobby than the
collecting of Topographical books, but each one
should confine himself to one County, or at
most two, and even with discrimination in
buying, a single County collection soon becomes
extensive. What should be aimed at in such
a collection is the putting together whatever
will illustrate the arch&aelig;ology, general history,
folk lore, dialect, and natural history, of a
district or County, and wherever there is a
Church and a Manor, there is a history. Each
parish history is the unit of the history of
the nation, and any one investigating the
parochial history of a single parish will find
much national history written in between the
lines. With regard to topographical and
genealogical books, I may say that the prices
of these are rapidly rising, and will continue to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a><a href="images/67.png">[67]</a></span>
rise, owing largely to the increasing competition
in America for these books.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Gilbey has, it is well known, a
fine collection of sporting books. There is no
sport but what has its literature, and if there is
one subject more than another, upon which the
English mind is unchanging, it is sport, and
this being so, sporting books will always offer a
fine field for collectors. As the coaching age
recedes farther back, so it will be found that an
increasing number of men will want to read
about what they no longer can hear <i>viva voce</i>.
All out-door subjects are good hobbies.
Flower culture and the laying out of grounds,
birds and natural history generally are good
subjects, but it must be understood that no one
can find another a subject, one can only <i>suggest</i>,
and that is all I propose to do here. Books offer
a very endless variety of hobbies. So I have
merely named one or two highways, and there
is an endless maze of bypaths which offer
delightful hunting grounds. Dr. Johnson, it
may be remembered, expressed a very sound
commonsense view of this matter to Boswell:</p>

<p>'When I mentioned that I had seen in the
King's Library fifty-three editions of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a><a href="images/68.png">[68]</a></span>
favourite <i>Thomas &agrave; Kempis</i> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in eight
languages .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Johnson said he thought it
unnecessary to collect many editions of a book
which were all the same except as to paper
and print. He would have the original, and all
the translations, and all editions having variations
in the text. He approved of the famous
collection of the editions of Horace by
Douglas, and, he added, "Every man should
try to collect one book in that manner.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."'</p>




<h2><span class="u"><i>Old Country Libraries.</i></span></h2>


<p>The library of Chaucer's Clerk of Oxenford,
which represented about the maximum
that an ordinary student would possess, consisted
of</p>

<div class='poem'>
'A twenty bokes, clothed in black and red,<br />
Of Aristotle and his philosophie,'<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>and these he kept 'at his beddes hed.'</div>

<p>Dr. Jessopp, in one of his learned papers,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
has pointed out that in the thirteenth century
the number of books in the world was, to say
the least, small. A library of five hundred
volumes would, in those days, have been considered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a><a href="images/69.png">[69]</a></span>
an important collection, and after
making all due allowances for ridiculous
exaggerations, which have been made by ill-informed
writers on the subject, it may safely
be said that nobody in the thirteenth century&mdash;at
any rate in England&mdash;would have erected a
large and lofty building as a receptacle for
books, simply because nobody could have contemplated
the possibility of filling it. Here
and there amongst the larger and more important
monasteries there were undoubtedly
collections of books, the custody of which was
entrusted to an accredited officer, but the time
had not yet come for making libraries well
stored with such priceless treasures as Leland,
the antiquary, saw at Glastonbury, just before
that magnificent foundation was given as a
prey to the spoilers. A library, in any such
sense as we now understand the term, was not
only no essential part of a monastery in those
days, but it may almost be said to have been
a rarity.</p>

<p>In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries we
rarely meet with any indications of a literary
taste among the laity; the books they purchased
were more for ornament than use.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a><a href="images/70.png">[70]</a></span>
But in the fifteenth century we find books
mentioned in a manner which would seem to
indicate that the laity were enabled to use
them with pleasure. In 1395, Alice, Lady
West, left to Joan, her son's wife, 'all
her books of Latin, English, and French;'
and from the memoranda of Sir John Howard,
we learn that that worthy knight could read
at his leisure 'an Englyshe boke, callyd <i>Dives
et Pauper</i>,' for which, and 'a Frenshe boke,'
in 1464, he paid thirteen shillings and fourpence.
The library of this member of the
Howard family was sufficiently extensive to
enable him to select therefrom, on the occasion
of his going to Scotland, thirteen volumes for
his solace and amusement on the voyage.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> In
the Paston <i>Letters</i> will be found a catalogue
of the library of one of the members of this
fifteenth century family. In the monasteries
books were, of course, used and treasured
long before they became part of the household
goods of rich laymen. The catalogue
of the House of the White Canons, at Titchfield,
in Hampshire, dated 1400, shows that
the books were kept in a small room on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a><a href="images/71.png">[71]</a></span>
shelves, and set against the walls. A closet
of this kind was evidently not a working
place, but simply a place of storage. By the
beginning of the fifteenth century, the larger
monasteries had accumulated many hundred
volumes, and it began to be customary to
provide for the collections separate quarters,
rooms constructed for the purpose. The
presses in the cloisters were still utilised
for books in daily reference.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Duke Humphrey
was a great book collector and
patron of letters, and presented to the University
of Oxford many of the illuminated
treasures which he had collected. The magnificent
collection of Charles V. of France,
also a great bibliomaniac, was brought by
the Duke of Bedford into England. This
library contained 853 volumes of great
splendour, and the introduction of these books
into England stimulated a spirit of inquiry
among the more wealthy laymen. Guy Beauchamp,
Earl of Warwick, collected a very fine
library of early romances, which about 1359,
he left to the monks of Bordesley Abbey, in
Worcestershire. A list of this library will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><a href="images/72.png">[72]</a></span>
be found in Todd's <i>Illustrations of Gower and
Chaucer</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. J. W. Clark has, with quite wonderful
learning, drawn a picture of student-life of
the past with such graphic vigour that we
can almost reinstate Colet, Casaubon, and
Erasmus, and picture them exactly as they
worked among their books. In Macaulay's
chapter upon <i>The State of England in 1685</i>,
are given numerous facts about the difficulty
the clergy had in getting books, and the little
desire there was among the squires to possess
libraries. Few knights of the shire had libraries
so good as may now perpetually be found in
a servants' hall, or in the back parlour of a
small shopkeeper. An esquire passed among
his neighbours for a great scholar if <i>Hudibras</i>
and <i>Baker's Chronicle</i>, <i>Tarleton's Jests</i>, and
the <i>Seven Champions of Christendom</i>, lay in
his hall window among the fishing rods and
fowling pieces. No circulating library, no
book society, then existed, even in the
capital; but in the capital those students
who could not afford to purchase largely
had a resource. The shops of the great
booksellers, near St. Paul's Churchyard, were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a><a href="images/73.png">[73]</a></span>
crowded every day and all day long with
readers. In the country there was no such
accommodation, and every man was under the
necessity of buying whatever he wished to
read. Macaulay further points out that Cotton
seems, from his <i>Angler</i>, to have found room
for his whole library in his hall window; and
Cotton was a man of letters. In the <i>Life of
Dr. John North</i> there is an account of that
delightful person's dealings with Mr. Robert
Scott, of Little Britain, a very famous bookseller
in the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Dr. John North is really a fascinating personality.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
His soul was 'never so staked
down as in an old bookseller's shop, for,
having taken orders, he was restless till he
had compassed some of that sort of furniture
as he thought necessary for his profession.</p>

<p>'I have borne him company,' says his
biographer, 'at shops for hours together,
and, minding him of the time, he hath
made a dozen proffers before he would
quit. By this care and industry he made
himself master of a very considerable library,
wherein the choicest collection was Greek.'</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a><a href="images/74.png">[74]</a></span></p>
<p>Pepys wished that his name should go
down to posterity as a man fond of books.
The arrangements for the settlement of his
library after death prove this. The numerous
references throughout the <i>Diary</i> show that
he had a passion for collecting, and showed
good judgment in what he got together.
Pepys, like Dr. John North, dealt of Robert
Scott, who, when sending his distinguished
customer four scarce books, the total cost
of which was only 1<i>l.</i> 14<i>s.</i>, writes, 'Without
flattery I love to find a rare book for you.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a><a href="images/75.png">[75]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>The contents of Pepys' famous collections
of Manuscripts, Books and rare single-sheet
literature are known more or less to students,
and are found by them to be of the utmost
value. It is amusing to notice how careful
Pepys was not to admit into his library any
'risky' books. Little did he think that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a><a href="images/78.png">[78]</a></span>
key to the diary would be one day discovered.
When he bought in the Strand 'an idle,
rogueish, French book, <i>L'Escholle des Filles</i>,'
he resolved, as already stated, as soon as he
had read it, to burn it, 'that it might not
stand in the list of books, nor among them,
to disgrace them, if it should be found.'
He was equally solicitous about Rochester's
<i>Poems</i>.</p>

<p>Pepys' books were numbered consecutively
throughout the library, and therefore, when
rearranged, they needed to be all renumbered.
This was done by Pepys himself, his wife,
and Deb Willett, who were busy until near
midnight 'titleing' the books.</p>

<p>With so many references to Pepys and his
book-collecting as we find in the <i>Diary</i>, it is
puzzling to read, under date, October 5, 1665,
after references to 'Sister Poll,' 'I abroad to
the office, and thence to the Duke of Albemarle,
all my way reading a book of Mr. Evelyn's
translating and sending me as a present, about
directions for gathering a library, <i>but the book is
above my reach</i>.' Pepys, one would think, had
by this time gone far enough in himself gathering
a library to understand the little pamphlet by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a><a href="images/79.png">[79]</a></span>
Naudeus, librarian to Cardinal Mazarin, which
Evelyn translated, and which was issued in
1661, and which is now very rare. There
is a charming letter from Evelyn to Pepys,
dated 12th August, 1689, giving very many
interesting details of the private libraries of
the seventeenth century, and which goes a
very long way to modify Macaulay's rather
overdrawn picture of the scarcity of books
and private libraries in 1685. This letter of
Evelyn's might be compared with Addison's
picture of 'Tom Folio' in the <i>Tatler</i>.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Tom
Folio stood for a great book collector, Thomas
Rawlinson.</p>

<p>The eighteenth century produced a host
of great book collectors. William Oldys,
Humphrey Wanley, and Thomas Rawlinson
just mentioned. These men were great experts,
who infected with enthusiasm many
great patrons of letters, such as Charles,
Earl of Sunderland, the Earl of Pembroke,
Lord Somers, Lord Oxford, Topham Beauclerk,
Colonel Stanley, and George Earl
Spencer, whose famous Library now at Manchester
has been called the finest private<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a><a href="images/80.png">[80]</a></span>
library in Europe. In his <i>Life of Sir Walter
Scott</i>, Lockhart has inserted a visitor's impression
of the library at Abbotsford. 'The
visitor might ransack a library, unique, I suppose,
in some of its collections, and in all
departments interesting and characteristic of
the founder. So many of the volumes were
enriched with anecdotes or comments in his
own hand, that to look over his books was, in
some degree, conversing with him.' The
catalogue of the Abbotsford library was printed
by the Maitland Club in 1838, and is one
of the best catalogues of a private collection
ever printed.</p>




<h2><span class="u"><i>Weeding Out.</i></span></h2>


<p>It is necessary that a large country-house
library should occasionally be weeded out and
overhauled. The libraries which were formed
in past generations cannot be expected to suit
present-day requirements. In a great many
country-house libraries there is little else than
a great mass of turgid theology, but very
often buried among these are really valuable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a><a href="images/81.png">[81]</a></span>
books. Upon the death of the head of a
family, the library should be carefully gone
over in order that the new owner may get
an idea of the books&mdash;a collection which he
may be excused from knowing much of as
he did not collect it. The books should
then be re-arranged to suit the views of
those who are most likely to use them, and
certain rejected volumes should be disposed
of and others put in their places.</p>

<p>How much this is necessary might be
illustrated by many anecdotes.</p>




<h2><span class="u"><i>The Catalogue.</i></span></h2>


<p>I have said, under the heading 'Classification,'
that it is not advisable or necessary
to attempt any rigid classification upon the
shelves. One good reason for this is that by
so doing you are trying to do what can so
much better be done by a catalogue. No one
who uses books very much but sooner or
later becomes grateful for the existence of
an alphabet and an arrangement by A B C.
Carlyle once said, 'A library is not worth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><a href="images/82.png">[82]</a></span>
anything without a catalogue; it is a Polyphemus
without any eye in his head, and you
must confront the difficulties, whatever they
may be, of making proper catalogues.'</p>

<p>'The classification of Pepys' library was to
be found in the catalogues, and as Pepys increased
in substance he employed experts to
do this work for him.'<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>No catalogue is of any use unless you can
tell from it (1) All that the library possesses
of the known books of a known author at one
view, as well as (2) All that it possesses, by
whomsoever written, on a known and definite
subject.</p>

<p>The old catalogues were mostly very bad.
Old methods have now given way to newer
and better bibliographical systems, and, to take
the case of a large country house, where books
are scattered about in many rooms, a catalogue
is most essential. The catalogue should, in
most cases, be in MS., and not typewritten. Such
an arrangement admits of additions being made
more easily. The printed catalogue is adopted
where the library is of special value, or if it
has any particular class of books predominating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a><a href="images/83.png">[83]</a></span>
to make it of use as a bibliography of a special
subject. Lord Crawford's sectional catalogues
of his library, already referred to, are the
most valuable lists I know of for student
purposes, but I believe very few people have
ever seen them.</p>

<p>The catalogue of Lord Crawford's Proclamations,
at Haigh Hall, is a marvel of industry
and accuracy. Mr. Locker Lampson's Rowfant
Library was catalogued, and the catalogue
printed and sold, because it had special
value as a collection of Elizabethan poetry.
Mr. Edmund Gosse's Library catalogue was
printed because it contained special collections
of seventeenth-century literature. Whether
the library be a student's library or a general
library, a catalogue is essential. Gibbon had
a catalogue of his books. I have seen so
many amateur attempts at cataloguing private
libraries that I am bound to say I do not
think the plan of cataloguing one's own
books in any way answers. Any catalogue
may be better than no catalogue, but, if a
catalogue is to be done, it is better by far
to call in the assistance of some one whose
work it is. It frequently happens that a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a><a href="images/84.png">[84]</a></span>
family inherits a large library, and the inheritors,
not having formed the collection,
naturally can know but little, if anything, of
its contents. Now, in such a case, and in
many other cases, the best plan is to have
your books overhauled, sifted, certain volumes
weeded out, if necessary, others rebound, and
the whole remainder carefully catalogued and
described, the cases being numbered and the
shelves lettered.</p>

<p>Very often the owner of a library sets
out to catalogue his or her own books, and
makes the initial mistake of entering them
one by one in a MS. volume already bound
up. Such a plan must end in failure and
disorder, because it is impossible by this
means to get the titles strictly alphabetical.
Others I have seen commence writing the
titles from the backs of the books. Other
difficulties which are encountered are with
anonymous books, and with such authors as
used pseudonyms, and, in some cases, many
pseudonyms. Such was Henri Beyle, whose
books bear various disguises, such as De
Stendhal, Cotonet, Salviati, Viscontini, Birkbeck,
Strombeck, C&eacute;sar Alexandre Bombet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a><a href="images/85.png">[85]</a></span>
The British Museum Library has ninety-one
rules of cataloguing, forming, perhaps, the best
cataloguing code in the world; but for private
libraries such elaboration and detail is not
necessary. The following are the main rules
to be adopted in private libraries:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>


<p>1. The catalogue should be arranged in one
general alphabet, this being the most useful and
the readiest form for reference. To render it,
as nearly as possible, a correct representation of
the contents of the library, each work has but
one principal descriptive entry. The shelfmark
is confined to this entry&mdash;duplicate shelfmark
references, when the position of books is
likely to be often altered, from the accession of
additions to the library, &amp;c., leading to frequent
and unavoidable errors.<br /><br /></p>


<p>2. This entry is under the author's name
when given on the title-page, or otherwise
known, as being the only arrangement which
allows one general rule to be followed throughout
the catalogue.<br /><br /></p>


<p>3. Anonymous works, whose authors' names<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a><a href="images/86.png">[86]</a></span>
are unknown, are placed under the subjects to
which they relate.<br /><br /></p>


<p>4. Cross references are made:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">from the subjects of biographies to the authors;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">from the principal anonymous and pseudonymous works to the writer's real names where known;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">from works included in, or noticed in the title-pages of other publications, to those publications.</span><br />
<br /><br /></p>


<p>5. To obviate the imperfections necessarily
attendant on an alphabetical arrangement, and
for the greater facility of reference, short classifications
are introduced of the chief subjects on
which the books in the library treat, referring
to the names of the authors in the same general
alphabet; thereby uniting the advantages of
the alphabetical and classified systems, and
acting in some measure as a key to the prevailing
character of the library.<br /><br /></p>


<p>6. All authors' names are followed by full
stops: any articles placed under a writer's
name, of which he is not the author, but which
are anonymous answers to, or criticisms on, his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a><a href="images/87.png">[87]</a></span>
works; anonymous memoirs placed under the
subjects; or any entries whatever, in which the
heading name prefixed is not that of the
author, are distinguished by a line following
the name.<br /><br /></p>


<p>7. The headings of the short classifications
are distinguished by being doubly underlined
with red ink. The name to be referred to is
singly underlined, but when the reference is to
another heading, and not to an author, it is
doubly underlined.</p>

<p>In preparing titles for the catalogue
(whether it be intended to transcribe or print
them), it should be an imperative instruction
that they be written on slips of paper (or on
cards) of uniform size. It is also useful to
include in them a word or two which may serve
to identify the origin of the books&mdash;whether by
purchase, by copyright, or by gift&mdash;and to
indicate the date of their respective acquisition.</p>




<h2><span class="u"><i>Classification of Books.</i></span></h2>


<p>The classification of books, according to any
set system, or according to subjects upon the
shelves of a library, is not easy, and for many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a><a href="images/88.png">[88]</a></span>
reasons it is not worth attempting. Unless the
library is a very large one, say, ten to twenty
thousand volumes, with ample and adaptable
shelving, it is not to be desired. The main difficulty
in shelf classification lies in the fact that
books on similar and kindred subjects are issued
in all sizes. There are books on Furniture, for
instance, in folio, in quarto, and in octavo.
When shelf classification is imperative, the
folios are all put together, the quartos together,
and the octavos together. This is the nearest
realisation of a shelf classification, and by this
method the folios may be far separated from
the quartos, and the quartos from the octavos.
Moreover, if appearance count for anything, as
indeed it should in the most modest library,
it will be impossible to carry out any plan of
shelf classification and preserve at the same time
an appearance of method and fitness. In planning
out how your books are to be placed, a
great consideration is the placing of them, so that
books likely to be frequently referred to shall be
easy of access, and books less likely to be in
request shall be housed higher up.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Reference<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a><a href="images/89.png">[89]</a></span>
books should, as far as possible, be placed together,
and all easy of access. The main divisions
into which a private library classes itself are History
and Biography, Fiction, Poetry and Drama,
Theology, Travel, Art, Belles lettres; but there
are so many considerations besides those of subject
in any general classification which should
determine the position of a volume that I must
emphasise what has already been said about
actual personal convenience being first studied,
and the library as arranged on the shelves
should be the result of personal convenience
and graceful effect. This is more particularly
necessary when a library is in course of expansion.
The subjects which will expand
quickest, and the space they will require, can
never be accurately gauged, and frequent upheavals
and readjustments will be necessary if
any rigid plan is aimed at. I would suggest
that a separate shelf&mdash;or, if necessary, a separate
case&mdash;be reserved for unbound periodicals
and for accessions, which are, as it were, <i>sub
judice</i>. Often, too, a separate case is necessary
for rare and handsome books, and a
locked case for <i>faceti&aelig;</i>. It is worth while to
observe that Pepys found that the best way to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a><a href="images/90.png">[90]</a></span>
find his numerous books was to number them
consecutively throughout the library.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Numerous elaborate plans of book classification
have been put forward, principally by
Americans, but in no way are they adaptable
to the requirements of private libraries, and I
doubt very much the possibility of comprehending
them in such a way as to apply
them in an intelligible manner even to public
libraries.</p>

<p>Mr. B. R. Wheatley, in an admirable paper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a><a href="images/91.png">[91]</a></span>
upon Library arrangement,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> gives the following
excellent practical advice:&mdash;</p>

<p>'If I had the planning of rooms for a
private library, I should select as the best
possible arrangement a suite of three rooms,
or one long room or gallery divided by columns
into three compartments, of which the centre
should be the largest, with several small contiguous
ante-rooms, the entrances to which, if
so desired, might be concealed, for uniformity
or completeness of appearance, by filling them
with sham or dummy book-backs, the titles of
which may be made an occasion for witticism
or joking allusion to local and family history.</p>

<p>'A good library arrangement is not achieved
at once, but is a slow growth through difficulties
met and conquered. Some of the best
portions of it will be those which have flashed
across your mind when there seemed no pathway
out of the thicket of difficulty in which you
were struggling. The arrangement of books,
where the shelves are not made to order to suit
your plans, must naturally be of a progressive
character in its development in your mind.</p>

<p>'In some old libraries, collected mostly in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a><a href="images/92.png">[92]</a></span>
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, there
is such a preponderance of those portly tomes
in folio in which our sturdy ancestors delighted,
that they materially affect and disconcert our
ordinary plans. I have known an instance in
which the library shelves projected slightly in
their upper part, and, there thus being an
appropriate depth, I arranged on these shelves
two long parallel rows, completely round the
room, of these noble volumes of our old
divines, State papers, Statutes, Treaties, Trials,
and our County histories; and the effect in
strength and power (as Ruskin might have
said) of these long lines of large stout books
of nearly equal height and size was really magnificent.
Sometimes you meet with such a valuable
and massive body of topography as will not
allow of its cavalierly being made a subsidiary
section of the class of history, and the form
and weighty character of the folios suggest
that some deep and separate bookcases should
be chosen in which it may assume the important
individuality that it deserves.</p>

<p>'Folios of a modern date, being of very
unequal sizes, would have a raggedness of
outline which would be less observed nearer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a><a href="images/93.png">[93]</a></span>
to the ground than in the elevated position
just referred to. As a general rule, a row of
folios on the lowest shelf will be succeeded by
one of quartos, and then above the ledge the
octavos and duodecimos will be placed, but
they should not ascend in too rigid a law of
gradual decrease. Rows of small books at
the top of a bookcase look as petty to
the mind as to the eyes, and, indeed, are
in general more appropriately placed in
dwarf bookcases specially fitted for their
reception.</p>

<p>'For small libraries, not exceeding 3000 to
4000 volumes, the letters of the alphabet may
be used for the cases, and small figures for the
shelves, on the principle of the greater including
the less, the letters having a more
important appearance. But in larger libraries,
where there is a chance of the alphabet being
doubled or trebled, one regular series of large
numbers for the cases, with small letters for the
shelves, is to be preferred.'</p>

<p>Books should be marked in pencil, with a
shelf letter and a case number.</p>

<p>Long sets of books need be numbered in
the first volume only.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a><a href="images/94.png">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>In the case of collections of pamphlets each
item ought to be separately catalogued.</p>

<p>The catalogue should complement the
arrangement on the shelves, and not be
tautological.</p>

<p>Tables of contents of collected editions
given in catalogue.</p>

<p>A synoptical table of contents should be
prefixed to the catalogue.</p>

<p>For those who desire a rough outline of
headings into which a library usually classifies
itself, I will name one. The briefest is as
follows:&mdash;(1) Theology, (2) Philosophy and
Science, (3) Art, (4) Political Economy,
(5) Law, (6) History and Literature.</p>




<h2><span class="u"><i>Bookcases.</i></span></h2>


<p>The chief faults of bookcases arise from their
being designed and made by men who have
never used a book. A first requisite in
bookcases is simplicity, bearing in mind
that the books are the ornament and not the
bookcases. The cabinet-maker, among other
things, is too fond of embellishments, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a><a href="images/95.png">[95]</a></span>
sacrifices space to what seem odd angularities
and irregularities.</p>

<p>No bookcase should be above eight and a
half feet in height. No ladder should be
necessary to get at books. If books are 'skied'
up to the ceiling they must suffer from the
heated air. It is heat, not gas merely, which
damages books.</p>

<p>A room may be made to look very beautiful
by being surrounded with fumed oak bookcases,
eight feet high. The shelves should
be made movable with Tonks' patent.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a><a href="images/96.png">[96]</a></span>
Gladstone<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> speaks of the looseness and the
tightness of movable shelves, the weary arms,
the aching fingers, and the broken finger-nails.
This can be avoided by the use of the patent
here named. The bottom cases should be deeper
and wider, to take quartos and folios, but there
should always be an extra shelf for turning a
folio section into an octavo section. Nineteen-twentieths
of the books in circulation are
octavos and smaller volumes. On each side
of the fireplace there should be an arm projecting
about four feet and a half. The inner
side of this should have a comfortable reading-seat,
and on the outer side, farthest from the
fire, there may be shelves for books. If the
structural arrangements of the room admit of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a><a href="images/97.png">[97]</a></span>
these projecting arms being placed, without
sacrifice of comfort, at a greater distance from
the fireplace, the books may be placed on the
upper part of the inner side as well, the lower
part being used as a lounge.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that heat and
excessive dryness are fatal to good bindings
and, indeed, to all parts of a book, and
therefore no bookcase should approach too
near a fireplace, nor should bookcases be
placed backing upon hot-water pipes. The
shelves should be edged with leather and such
leather must <i>not</i> be stiffened by cardboard
or brown paper&mdash;simply leather, and there
should be a roller shutter of silk to draw
down in front of the books during absence
from home. The cases<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> should everywhere
be perfectly flush, without any sort of protruding
ornament. It will be found a great
advantage to make the framework of the
various cases of equal dimensions, so that
the shelves can be made transferable. In
estimating the extent of shelving which
it may be necessary to provide, we may
calculate that in an ordinary library a space<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a><a href="images/98.png">[98]</a></span>
two feet high and two feet wide will, on
an average, contain about thirty-five volumes,
and it may be estimated roughly that every
thousand volumes in a library will require
about a hundred square feet of shelving.</p>

<p>If fixed shelves are made, the usual height
will be&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Shelf height">
<tr><td align='left'>For&nbsp;</td><td align='left'>folios&nbsp;</td><td align='left'>18&nbsp;</td><td align='left'>to&nbsp;</td><td align='left'>21&nbsp;</td><td align='left'>inches.</td></tr>

</table></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a><a href="images/99.png">[99]</a></span></p>
<p>These spaces will allow ample room for the
average sizes. The 'Atlas' folios and 'Elephant'
folios are best accommodated in single shelves,
in which they may be flat, or on trays or
table cases.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Bear in mind always to allow
sufficient space for expansion. Nothing causes
more disorder than insufficient shelf accommodation.
All cases should be numbered
and lettered, that is, each section should
have a number, and each shelf a letter. For
the accommodation of expensive bindings or
rare books and MSS., a special case may
sometimes be required. Very beautiful specimens
of such may be seen sketched in the
books of Chippendale, Sheraton, and Heppelwhite,
but it is in all cases better to avoid glass
fronts and adopt ornamental brass wire work
if any special protection be needed.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Blades, a great expert in this
matter, said, 'It is a mistake to imagine that
keeping the best-bound volumes in a glass-doored
bookcase is a preservative. The damp
air will certainly penetrate, and as the absence
of ventilation will assist formation of mould, the
books will be worse off than if they had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a><a href="images/100.png">[100]</a></span>
placed in open shelves. If securing be desirable,
by all means abolish the glass and place ornamental
brass wire work in its stead.'<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>'It is more important to see that the
shelves intended for choice and richly bound
books should be covered with leather, and
expressly such as are intended for books of
large sizes. In the case of books of special
value, the leather should be well padded, should
be of the best quality, and should have a
polished surface.'<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>In the <i>Nineteenth Century</i> for March,
1890, already quoted from, Mr. Gladstone
wrote upon 'Books, and the Housing of
them.' This paper showed a sound grasp of
the subject and showed Mr. Gladstone in a
new and very interesting light. Appended are
some extracts from this paper, all of which I
think experts would agree to, <i>except the fixed
shelves</i>, and here, I think, any one who has
handled books very much will be at issue with
Mr. Gladstone. He himself says:&mdash;'I have
recommended that, as a rule, the shelves be
fixed, and have given reasons for the adoption<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a><a href="images/101.png">[101]</a></span>
of such a rule. I do not know whether it will
receive the sanction of authorities, and I make
two admissions. First, it requires that each
person owning and arranging a library should
have a pretty accurate general knowledge of
the size of his books. Secondly, it may be
expedient to introduce here and there, by way
of exception, a single movable shelf.'</p>

<p>Now, a man must be able not only to gauge
very accurately the limits of his library and the
various sizes of books, but he must be able to
look into the future if he would safely embark
on fixed shelves. And this is wholly impossible.
Fixed shelves should only be adopted where
cost has to be reduced to a minimum, but in
the majority of instances movable shelves
will be found preferable. The paragraphs
which deal with bookcases in Mr. Gladstone's
article may here be given:&mdash;</p>

<p>'The question of economy, for those who
from necessity or choice consider it at all, is
a very serious one. It has been a fashion to
make bookcases ornamental. Now, books want
for and in themselves no ornament at all.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The man who looks for society in his books
will readily perceive that, in proportion as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a><a href="images/102.png">[102]</a></span>
face of his bookcase is occupied by ornament,
he loses that society; and conversely, the more
that face approximates to a sheet of book-backs,
the more of that society he will enjoy. And so
it is that three great advantages come hand in
hand, and, as will be seen, reach their maximum
together: the sociability of books, minimum
cost in providing for them, and ease of access
to them.</p>

<p>'In order to attain these advantages, two
conditions are fundamental. First, the shelves
must, as a rule, be fixed; secondly, the cases,
or a large part of them, should have their side
against a wall, and thus, projecting into the
room for a convenient distance, they should be
of twice the depth needed for a single line of
books, and should hold two lines, one facing
each way. Twelve inches is a fair and liberal
depth for two rows of octavos. The books are
thus thrown into stalls, but stalls after the
manner of a stable.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This method of dividing
the longitudinal space by projections at
right angles to it, if not very frequently used,
has long been known. A great example of it
is to be found at Trinity College, Cambridge,
and is the work of Sir Christopher Wren. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a><a href="images/103.png">[103]</a></span>
has kept these cases down to a very moderate
height; for he doubtless took into account that
great heights require long ladders, and that the
fetching and use of these greatly add to the
time consumed in getting or replacing a book.'</p>

<p>It must here be added that Mr. Gladstone's
plan is much more fitted for a large public
library than for the library of a private person,
for whom he is prescribing. Though the library
in the form of an annexe<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> is in many ways
an ideal form for housing a large library, yet
these are hardly likely to be in the majority,
and most people find that they have to house
their books in a circumscribed space, with no
room for such bays and projections as he
suggests except perhaps one by the fireplace.</p>




<h2><span class="u"><i>Miscellaneous Appliances.</i></span></h2>


<p>Whether the library be considered as a
workshop or a morning-room, there are certain
necessary appliances, which will contribute a
great deal to comfort, and the proper preservation
of books. Thus, proper tables will be
required. Mr. Gladstone, I believe, has, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a><a href="images/104.png">[104]</a></span>
had, three tables in his Temple of Peace&mdash;one
for correspondence, one for politics, and
one for literary work. This, no doubt, is a
very excellent plan to be followed by those
whose time is precious, and who have to
divide each day up for fixed duties. The
'Shannon' and other American tables are very
excellent for correspondence work, being fitted
with pigeon-holes and drawers, and I have
no doubt but that equally well-made tables
are made specially fitted for literary work.
Such a table should measure not less than
six feet by three; its top should be a clear,
flat surface, and it should stand firmly on its
legs, and these legs should be four, and should
not be placed to be in the way of the person
sitting at the table. An ink-well should be
sunk flush with the top of the case, and it
should have a brass cover. A knee-hole table
is not the best for literary work, but it may
be the best for letter-writing. Of chairs, one
good, firm, hard-seated chair is necessary.
Mr. Ellwanger<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> says, 'I have two chairs for my
reading&mdash;a stiff one for books I <i>have</i> to read;
a luxurious one for books I like to read. My<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a><a href="images/105.png">[105]</a></span>
luxurious chair is of dark green leather, a treat
to sink into, modelled after the easy armchair
of the Eversley Rectory, known from its seductive
properties as "Sleepy Hollow."' A
very prettily designed and useful hard-seated
chair is that known as the Goldsmith chair,
being modelled upon the chair which belonged
to Oliver Goldsmith. A revolving bookcase
is a very appropriate article of furniture in a
library. It may be made especially useful
for reference-books, or any such books as are
being used together at one time for purposes
of study and comparison. These revolving
bookcases are made in all sizes, and can, of
course, be made to suit any particular requirement;
thus I have seen them made with a top
which can be raised to a slope with a ledge
like a standing desk, upon which a large atlas
can be rested and consulted. Apart from this,
I strongly recommend the use of a standing
desk for health's sake when a great deal of
writing has to be done.</p>

<p>It frequently happens that books being
taken from the shelf, the volumes left behind
fall down in an untidy heap. To obviate
this, there is a very simple form of metal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a><a href="images/106.png">[106]</a></span>
book support sold, which keeps a half-filled
shelf neat and tidy. An alternative to this
is the old plan of inserting dummies, whereby
no blanks are seen. As I have so strongly
advocated shelves the tops of which are within
reach of the hand, I need not say much about
steps, but where steps are really needed, they
should be <i>very</i> light, and capable of being
easily lifted with one hand. They should have
an upright rod support rising about four feet
above the top step; this for the purpose of
safety when using the steps. Cabinets of
drawers for prints and very large books should
also be secured if required, and cushioned
desks for books with metal bosses or metal
mountings of any description. Last, but by
no means least, let there be good ink, and
plenty of it; good pens, and a variety of them;
and good blotting-paper, frequently renewed;
and paper-knives of various sizes.</p>




<h2><span class="u"><i>The Library Annexe.</i></span></h2>


<p>What in many ways is an ideal library is a
library housed in a building specially constructed
as an annexe to a residence. I feel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a><a href="images/107.png">[107]</a></span>
sure that, within the next ten years, there will
be many moderately wealthy men who will be
anxious to form libraries and special collections
of books, housing them in this way. The idea
is only new as applied to large country mansions.
Hitherto students of moderate means
have managed to construct buildings specially
adapted for study and free from interruption.
The only instance of a library annexe attached
to a country mansion with which I am acquainted
is the recent and very notable instance
at Hawarden, of which more later. The late
Vicar of Middleton Cheney, in Oxfordshire,
and, I think, Dr. Jessopp, of Scarning, have both
found that their work has been assisted by library
annexes. Horace Walpole said of Topham
Beauclerk that he had built a library in Great
Russell Street, that reached 'half-way to Highgate.'
Lord Bacon spent ten thousand pounds
in building himself a retreat in his grounds at
Gorhambury.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone's scheme at Hawarden is
likely to be followed by many others.
Of course the Hawarden library has been
endowed, and made practically open and free.
It is the idea of a private library as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a><a href="images/108.png">[108]</a></span>
temple of peace for the owner and his visitors
which we would like to see extended. One
fancies that books might be on a better footing
in country houses if they had the honour of a
separate building. Then they would, at any
rate, be on as good a footing as the stables
or as the greenhouse, which at present they are
not. Books are not so much wall covering,
or so much furniture. They are much more;
they should be treated more like living creatures,
and if only their owners would get upon
speaking terms with them, how readily would
they get a response. Roughly, then, one would
like to see attached to every large country
establishment a book building, a centre of intelligence
and light, where we might be sure
of finding a good atlas, a good biographical
dictionary, and good verbal dictionary. I do not
understand why so little importance has hitherto
been attached to this. Such a building should
have a large central room and several separate
small rooms for private study. The illustrations
in a charming little book called
<i>Mr. Gladstone in the Evening of his Days</i>
convey what is meant very well. From this
little volume I give extracts which seem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a><a href="images/109.png">[109]</a></span>
very clear to any one interested in this
matter:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Everywhere about in the large room are
books&mdash;books&mdash;books. The Iron Library
(the building is of iron) is arranged in the same
ingenious way as Mr. Gladstone's private
library at Hawarden Castle. There are windows
on either side of the long room, and
between these windows high bookcases, running
towards the centre of the room, are put
up. There are books on either side of these
cases, and the part facing the centre of the
room is again arranged to hold books. It is
truly marvellous how many books can thus be
stored without a single one being out of
sight.'</p>

<p>'There is the same simplicity, the same
quiet comfort, the same air of repose, and
the same absence of library conventionality
about.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.'</p>

<p>'Through a door .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you reach the second
room in the library, to which Mr. Gladstone
has given the name of the "Humanity room."
It is arranged on exactly the same plan as
the first, and contains secular works chiefly.
You note Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;'s <i>Letters</i> on one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a><a href="images/110.png">[110]</a></span>
shelf, in neat and dainty little volumes; and
yellow-backed Zola lower down.'<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Any one who proposed having a library as a
separate building should certainly study Mr.
Gladstone's experiments at St. Deiniol's Library,
or procure <i>Mr. Gladstone in the Evening of his
Days</i>, wherein are given illustrations of the interior
plan and general economy of the structure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a><a href="images/111.png">[111]</a></span>
Certainly Mr. Gladstone's ideas as to the
arrangement of books as put forth in the
<i>Nineteenth Century</i> for March, 1890, are
much more applicable to an annexe library
than to the housing of books in an ordinary
private dwelling. Thus the arrangement of
the bays made by the projections could not
be carried out without extensive structural
alterations in one house out of twenty in the
country, and not one house out of a thousand
in London. His ideas, however, are wholly
practicable and admirably thorough when
applied to the annexe library. It is interesting
to see Mr. Gladstone's calculations
as to shelf accommodation. They were disputed
at the time by some cavilling critics,
but have since been shown to be accurate.
Mr. Gladstone is speaking<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> of the bookcases
round the walls and the projecting arms, and
he says:&mdash;'I will now exhibit to my readers the
practical effect of such arrangement in bringing
great numbers of books within easy reach.
Let each projection be three feet long, twelve
inches deep (ample for two faces of octavos),
and nine feet high, so that the upper shelf<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a><a href="images/112.png">[112]</a></span>
can be reached by the aid of a wooden stool
of two steps, not more than twenty inches
high, and portable without the least effort of
a single hand. I will suppose the wall-space
available to be eight feet, and the projections,
three in number, with end pieces, need only
put out three feet five, while narrow strips of
bookcase will run up the wall between the
projections. Under these conditions, the bookcases
thus described will carry about 2000
volumes.</p>

<p>'And a library forty feet long and twenty
feet broad, amply lighted, having some portion
of the centre fitted with very low bookcases,
suited to serve for some of the uses
of tables, will receive on the floor from 18,000
to 20,000 volumes of all sizes without losing
the appearance of a room .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. while leaving
portions of space available near the windows
for purposes of study. If a gallery be added,
there will be accommodation for a further
number of 5000, and the room need be no
more than sixteen feet high.'</p>

<p>This estimate of shelf accommodation
may be compared with one which was made
by Mr. Justin Winsor, the well-known librarian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a><a href="images/113.png">[113]</a></span>
of the Harvard library. He says:&mdash;'The
book room of the Roxbury branch of the
public library of Boston is fifty-three feet
long by twenty-seven feet wide, and having
three storeys of eight feet each in height
will hold 100,000 volumes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I doubt
if any other construction can produce this
result.'</p>

<p>The building at Hawarden cost, I believe,
1000<i>l.</i>, but whether this is with fittings or not
I do not know. It is certain that for men
whose books are more numerous than costly
the annexe plan is admirable, and the difficulty
of excluding damp where four walls are
exposed to the elements could surely be overcome.
I do not think that Mr. Gladstone
makes any mention of iron bookcases, but
these are often adopted, and have been made
in a very convenient form, particularly that
called the Radcliffe iron bookcase, arranged by
Sir Henry Acland and Mr. W. Froude. Of
this I append a description written by Sir
Henry Acland himself.</p>

<p>'The advantages of the bookcase consist
in its great stability, in its movability and
neatness. It carries 500 average octavo volumes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a><a href="images/114.png">[114]</a></span>
250 on either side; it is seven feet
high, and stands on any floor space on forty-eight
inches by eighteen inches. The cases
may stand in any number end to end, or
down the centre of a passage, or be placed
so as to form squares of any dimensions
multiple of the length of the cases, and therefore
may enclose studies lined with books,
books being also on the outside of the square.
When the cases stand end to end they need
not be put close to each other, but may have
a space in which are shelves of any desired
length. Therefore ten iron cases placed in a line,
so as to include a space of forty inches between
each two cases, will carry the contents of nineteen
cases, or 5000 plus 4500 volumes, at the
cost of ten cases, plus the wooden shelves of
nine. The iron framework costs about 5<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i>,
and the wooden shelves about 25<i>s.</i> The iron
portion will carry only octavos, but the spaces
as described above will carry folios, because,
to insure stability in the iron frames, diagonal
ties run down the centre and divide the shelves
into two portions, viz., the two frontages described
above. But the stability being ensured
in each iron case independently, the intermediate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a><a href="images/115.png">[115]</a></span>
shelves in the spaces may be of
the full width of the frames, namely, twenty
inches.'<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>




<h2><span class='u'><i>A Librarian.</i></span></h2>


<p>Until we have more properly trained librarians,
it is useless to recommend owners of
private libraries to find a librarian, because at
present there are very few such men in existence
who are properly qualified. A love of
books is not enough in a librarian. An orderly
mind and great receptive power are most
essential. Practical knowledge of bookbinding
and a sense of colour are equally essential.
He must have no fads of his own to be ever
thrusting forward. If he is mad on Geology or
Astronomy, he won't do. What, above all, he
must know are the sources of information.</p>

<p>A study in the 'Lives' of some of the great
librarians would best show what is here meant.
Mr. Elton<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> names Antonio Maggliabecchi, the
jeweller's shop-boy, who became renowned
throughout the world for his abnormal knowledge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a><a href="images/116.png">[116]</a></span>
of books. He never at any time left Florence;
but he read every catalogue that was issued, and
was in correspondence with all the collectors and
librarians of Europe. He was blessed with a
prodigious memory, and knew all the contents
of a book by 'hunting it with his finger,' or
once turning over the pages. He was believed,
moreover, to know the habitat of all the rare
books in the world; and according to the well-known
anecdote he replied to the Grand Duke,
who asked for a particular volume: 'The only
copy of this work is at Constantinople, in the
Sultan's library, the seventh volume in the
second bookcase, on the right as you go in.'
A similar story was told by Wendell Phillips,
the American statesman, about a countryman
of his own, George Sumner. An Englishman
came to Rome and was anxious to know
whether there was in the library of the Pope,
the great library of the Vatican, a certain book.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The gentleman went to the Italians that
used the library. They referred him to the
private secretary of one of the cardinals, and
after a moment's thought the secretary answered,
'No, sir, I don't know; but there is a young
man in the city from Boston, and if the book is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a><a href="images/117.png">[117]</a></span>
there he will know. They went to George
Sumner, and asked him if there was such a
volume in the library. 'Yes, it is in the tenth
alcove, the third shelf, the seventh book to
your right as you enter.'</p>

<p>Similar stories, doubtless, could be told of
Bradshaw, the Cambridge University librarian,
or of Thomas Ruddiman and George Buchanan.</p>

<p>Mr. Lloyd P. Smith<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> gives the following
definition, among others, of the qualifications of
a librarian: 'Librarians, like editors and proofreaders,
are expected to know everything; and
in one sense they should know everything&mdash;that
is, they should have that <i>maxima pars
eruditionis</i>, which consists in knowing where
everything is to be found. A librarian should
be able, of his own knowledge, to answer many
questions, and especially the two questions
which meet him at every turn, "Where can I
find such-and-such information?" and "What
is the best work on such-and-such a subject?"
These are legitimate questions, which it should
be the pride of every librarian to answer offhand .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
All the book-learning in the world,
however, will be insufficient for the practical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a><a href="images/118.png">[118]</a></span>
duties of his place, unless the librarian has also
the organ of order. His motto should be,
"A place for everything and everything in its
place."'</p>

<p>'The book of regulations for the court and
household of Guidobaldo I. contains these rules
for the administration of the library:&mdash;"The
librarian should be learned, of good presence,
temper, and manners, correct, and ready of
speech. He must get from the gardrobe an
inventory of the books, and keep them arranged
and easily accessible, whether Latin, Greek,
Hebrew, or others, maintaining also the rooms
in good condition. He must preserve the
books from damp and vermin, as well as from
the hands of trifling, ignorant, dirty, and tasteless
persons. To those of authority and learning,
he ought himself to exhibit them with all
facility, courteously explaining their beauty and
remarkable characteristics, the handwriting and
miniatures, but observant that such abstract no
leaves. When ignorant or merely curious
persons wish to see them, a glance is sufficient,
if it be not some one of considerable influence.
When any lock or other requisite is needed, he
must take care that it be promptly provided.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a><a href="images/119.png">[119]</a></span>
He must let no book be taken away but by
the Duke's orders, and if lent, must get a
written receipt, and see to its being returned.
When a number of visitors come in, he must
be specially watchful that none be stolen. All
which is duly seen to by the present courteous
and attentive librarian, Messer Agabito."'<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>




<h2><span class="u"><i>The Library Architecturally.</i></span></h2>


<p>Vitruvius, in his <i>Architecture</i>, lays down
the rule that libraries ought to face the east,
because their use requires the morning light,
which will preserve their contents from decay;
whereas, if the room should face the south
or west, they are liable to be damaged by
damp. Mr. J. W. Clark, the very learned
historian of the University of Cambridge, commenting
on this, says that the first of these
considerations did influence early builders, but
after the Reformation, when considerations of
personal comfort began to be generally
accepted, the library could be placed in the
position which commanded the greatest amount
of warmth. Ancient libraries were never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a><a href="images/120.png">[120]</a></span>
placed on the ground, but usually on the
first floor, or even higher, for the sake of
preserving their contents from the damp to
which ground floors are necessarily subject.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>The architect is very frequently a great
enemy to the library. Underestimating the
amount of wall space likely to be required for
the housing of the books, or placing shelves
and galleries in such a position that the books
are not readily got at. Frequently, too, a
country house has no room whatever designed
either for study or the reception of books.
The entire collection of books should be accessible
without steps or ladders. Hot-water pipes
should not approach nearer than three feet to
the books. Electric light is the best luminant,
but gas may safely be used provided there is
sufficient ventilation.</p>

<p>The walls, which are towards the outer air,
and even the others also, if of brick or stone,
ought to be battened.</p>

<p>I have taken from a very excellent book,
Kerr's <i>Gentleman's House</i>, such ideas and
notes as I think are likely to be useful in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a><a href="images/121.png">[121]</a></span>
arranging a library in a country house. Mr.
Kerr suggests two plans for a large country
house with a library.</p>

<p>'The idea which might first occur to the
mind is that of a single spacious apartment;
but for convenience and in order to preserve
the domestic character, it is generally preferable
to make use of several smaller apartments
as a <i>Suite of Libraries</i>. On this plan the
arrangement which is perhaps most favourable
to considerations of utility, and on the whole
most characteristic, is to set out a given width of
clear passage way along the central line of the
rooms, and then to divide the space on each
side into a succession of compartments or bays,
by means of transverse bookcases in pairs back
to back; such bays being only large enough to
accommodate a reading table with sufficient
space around for reaching the books, opening
the doors of the cases if any, and so on. If the
rooms be lighted from the roof, the lights ought
to correspond with the division into compartments,
so that none of the fronts of the bookcases
shall be placed in shadow. If there be
windows in the walls, there ought to be one in
each bay along one side of the room or both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a><a href="images/122.png">[122]</a></span>
as may be desired. Bookcases against the
walls are obviously most serviceable with the
ceiling light; with side windows, even when
these are on a high level, there is always a difficulty
in reading the back lettering under the
light; and when the windows are on a low
level, dwarf bookcases under them are practically
of little use.</p>

<p>'As for <i>artistic treatment</i>, nothing can be
more appropriate for the character of a library
than those effects which are at the command of
the architect in a suite of apartments of this
kind, laid out probably with some variety in the
general forms as well as in the fittings, and
involving perhaps the introduction of sculptures
and paintings of a suitable kind. Elaborate
effects, however, of whatever sort, and the
accommodation of any other works of art than
those whose merits are kindred to the character
of the more proper contents, ought not to be
encouraged.'</p>

<p>A second or alternative plan is a large
room with a gallery.</p>

<p>'As regards curiosities and other <i>artistic or
scientific collections</i>, these may very properly be
accommodated, whether in upright cases to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a><a href="images/123.png">[123]</a></span>
correspond with the bookcases, or in cabinets
to take the place of the reading tables.</p>

<p>'The arrangements proper for the alternative
plan of a large <i>single library</i> are obviously
simple. A gallery is probably carried round
the apartment; the bookcases extend along
the wall below and are reproduced above; the
light comes either from the roof or the upper part
of the walls; the floor area is generally occupied
solely by reading tables and cabinets. Objects
of art and curiosity, when of large size, are
more prominently displayed by this arrangement,
and the whole effect may be made very
imposing; but it is doubtful whether convenience
and comfort can by any means be so
properly provided for as in the other model.</p>

<p>'There are questions of detail which might
be further entered upon, but a reference to
what has already been advanced under the head
of the ordinary library will probably suffice.'</p>

<p>In other parts of his excellent manual,
Mr. Kerr goes more into detail, and refers to
the various general purposes to which a
library, as distinct from a study, is put in a
country house, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>'There is a certain standard room which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a><a href="images/124.png">[124]</a></span>
constitutes the library of an average gentleman's
house, and the various gradations by
which this may be either diminished in importance
or augmented are easily understood. It
is not a library in the sole sense of a depository
for books. There is, of course, the family
collection, and the bookcases in which this is
accommodated form the chief furniture of the
apartment. But it would be an error, except
in very special circumstances, to design the
library for mere study. It is primarily a sort
of morning-room for gentlemen rather than
anything else. Their correspondence is done
here, their reading, and, in some measure, their
lounging; and the billiard-room, for instance,
is not unfrequently attached to it. At the
same time the ladies are not exactly excluded.</p>

<p>'The <i>position</i> of the room internally ought
therefore to be in immediate connexion with
the principal dwelling rooms, so as to be
equally accessible; whilst, on the other hand,
as regards external influences, it ought to be
kept sufficiently quiet (although this is very
seldom a practical problem), to prevent the
interruption of reading or writing. In accordance
with these general ideas, and bearing out,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a><a href="images/125.png">[125]</a></span>
moreover, the somewhat sober effect which
bookcases always produce, the <i>style</i> of design
and decoration ought to be, although not
devoid of cheerfulness, certainly subdued in
character.'</p>

<p>As regards aspect, Mr. Kerr is at one with
the old Vitruvius already referred to.</p>

<p>'It is not often easy to obtain a choice <i>aspect</i>
for the library, but whenever this primary
pleasantness can be had for it so much the
better, and it certainly ought never to be
entirely neglected in this respect. The reasons
for preferring the south-east in the case of
day rooms generally have already been argued;
for a library, perhaps, a rather more eastward
aspect is better, so that the sun may be off the
windows at least before noon; even due east
might be preferred by some persons, the sunshine
being thus lost about half-past ten. In
any case, however, the morning sun is to be
preferred to that of midday or afternoon. If
the room be large enough <i>end windows</i> may be
used to advantage here as elsewhere. A <i>bay
window</i> also is often adopted.</p>

<p>'A difficult question which often arises is
how sufficiently to provide for persons engaged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a><a href="images/126.png">[126]</a></span>
in writing a <i>front light from the left</i>. It is not
that a snug seat by the fireside, with a table conveniently
at hand, and a left front light, can by
any possibility be provided for many persons
at once; but it is very unfortunate when no
position whatever will combine these advantages.
In a library especially this problem
must be well worked out, and not for one
writer only, but for several. Ingenuity and
perseverance will accomplish wonders, and
therefore, with the help of end light, a good
library may be expected in this respect to be
brought very near perfection.</p>

<p>'The <i>fireplace</i> ought to be placed so as to
make a good winter fireside, because this is in
a measure a sitting-room.</p>

<p>'<i>Intercommunication</i> is frequently made with
the drawing-room, and sometimes intimately,
and this carries with it, no doubt, a certain
sort of convenience, because the two rooms
can be thrown together occasionally; but it is a
question whether, in a good house, and looking
at such a question broadly, it is not, on the whole,
a serious loss to both rooms as regards their more
proper purposes. A door to the dining-room
is not formally advisable, nor even one to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a><a href="images/127.png">[127]</a></span>
gentleman's room, although both these arrangements
are to be met with, and are occasionally
convenient. A communication with the billiard-room,
sometimes made, may give the
library too completely the character of a
lounge, so as to render it somewhat unfit for
its better purposes. When the library of
a small house is used as a study, by a
clergyman, for instance, or as the business
room, a door to the dining-room may be so
useful as to be specially admissible, the dining-room
being thus brought to serve as a waiting-room
for the occasion. The interposition, if
possible, of a lobby or small ante-room will,
however, be an aid to propriety in almost all
these cases.</p>

<p>'It is to be observed that we have been
hitherto dealing with the ordinary library of
an average house and no more; but when the
owner is a man of learning we must either add
a <i>study</i> or constitute the library itself one. In
the latter case, in order to prevent disturbance,
the door will be more conveniently placed, not
in the main corridor, but indirectly connected
therewith. No door of intercommunication
ought to connect it with any other room (except<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a><a href="images/128.png">[128]</a></span>
possibly the gentleman's room), and the position
externally ought to be more than ordinarily
secluded. Double doors also may be
required. In short, the library, which has
hitherto been a public room and somewhat of
a lounge, becomes now essentially a private
retreat.</p>

<p>'When the books form a <i>large collection</i>,
and strangers, perhaps, are occasionally admitted
for reading or reference, the library
necessarily assumes more extensive proportions,
and its arrangements become more complicated.
For example, heating apparatus becomes very
possibly indispensable; the question comes up
of ceiling lights; the apartments are probably
carried up to the height of two storeys, and
galleries formed around. Seclusion becomes
again still more a point to be considered.</p>

<p>'The library of the house should also be as
comfortable as possible, with broad easy
chairs, low centre table for books and periodicals,
a large pedestal desk with circular
revolving top, to shut up all papers and
keep them free from dust. This kind of
desk I consider invaluable to any man who
really uses his library as a work-room, whether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a><a href="images/129.png">[129]</a></span>
it be for real literary work and study, or
for the ordinary examination and arrangement
of household accounts; for it is quite impossible,
on an ordinary writing table, to
keep papers clean or tidy, and this circular-headed
desk shuts down at once papers as
they lie, which then cannot be "tidied" by
the housemaid, who would seem to take a
pleasure in putting away papers and notes
in all kinds of out-of-the-way corners; the
desk should have plenty of drawers and
pigeon-holes; these latter, not as many of
them are, an inch too narrow or two inches
too wide for ordinary letters, but all made for
the objects for which they are intended. It
may seem absurd to say&mdash;think carefully of
the use to which the drawers are to be put&mdash;but
how often are they practically useless
or wasteful of precious room, by being made
shallower or deeper than is required. The
room should be surrounded with bookcases,
the lower portion made to take large books,
and with some part of it covered in with
cupboard fronts, with shelving inside to file
away periodicals and papers; the shelf which
this lower projection forms will do admirably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a><a href="images/130.png">[130]</a></span>
for the arrangement of ornaments, small busts,
or other personal things, with which a man
crowds the room he really lives in; of course,
I am speaking to those who make a den
or working-room of their library, and not
to those who fit a back room up with
various tiers of shelving, on which are arranged
a library of books which are seldom looked
at, and where the room is only occasionally
used, and that only for the purpose of a cloak-room
on grand occasions. Above this lower
nest of cupboards and shelving should be
shelving arranged for various sizes of books,
part carried up all round the room, so as
to be within easy reach; the top of these
will be found useful for china or busts, or
other objects of art, while the centre portions
may be carried up to the ceiling to give
greater accommodation; all these breaks will
take away from the stiffness of the room,
and, if properly arranged, will all assist in
making the library a room pleasant to work
or play in. All this kind of work can be
made of plain deal, stained and polished,
and is infinitely cheaper than the elaborate
movable cases of wainscot or walnut, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a><a href="images/131.png">[131]</a></span>
which the aim of the designer seems often
to make the frame-work as expensive as
possible, whereas, in truth, the books within
are really what should be thought of and
cared for.</p>

<p>'The floor should be painted or stained
and varnished all over, so as to be easily
cleaned and dusted, and everything that is
likely to permanently hold dust should be
avoided. On the floor, thus painted, a few
cheap Indian or other rugs may be laid about
in places where most necessary and useful.</p>

<p>'Too much trouble cannot be taken to
make the library a pleasant room to live in;
it should have everything arranged and adapted
for use and comfort, and not be stiff and dreary
with any set arrangement. The panels of
the cupboard doors may be filled in with
Japanese lacquer-work or painted decoration,
and here and there, in the recesses, nests
of shelves may be fitted with projecting
brackets, designed as part of them, for
pieces of china, vases of flowers, or busts,
and not looking like bats stuck on to a
barn door.</p>

<p>'I must not omit to say that in the lower<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a><a href="images/132.png">[132]</a></span>
portion of the bookcase should be arranged
drawers&mdash;not carried down to the floor, for
these are inconvenient&mdash;for use for prints
and valuable photographs and sketches.</p>

<p>'The library should be essentially home-like,
with the wall-space fitted up as conveniently
as possible; on the top of the
bookcases or nests of shelves, spring roller-blinds
might be easily arranged in the cornices
to draw down at night or other times, and
fasten with clips to protect and preserve the
books, &amp;c., within them.</p>

<p>'I might offer many other suggestions for
the decoration and furniture of the rooms I
have specially referred to. I trust those I
have made will be of some practical use,
and that, above all, you will believe that
my aim throughout has been to avoid all
dogmatic and set rules of fashion or design,
and to insist only that truth and beauty of
form and colour, combined with fitness and
common sense, are the main elements of all
true artistic treatment in decoration and furniture
of modern houses.'<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<h2><span class="u"><i>Munificent Book-buying.</i></span></h2>


<p>Nordau has estimated that, in England
alone, there are from eight hundred to a thousand
millionaires, and in Europe altogether,
there are at least a hundred thousand persons
with fortunes of a million and even more. One
could hope that it might be considered a kindness
now and then to remind some of these
millionaires of certain openings for their money
which do not, so far, seem to have occurred to
them. Mr. Bernard Shaw not long since
pointed out in the <i>Contemporary Review</i> an
opening whereby an Economic Library might be
established, and do great lasting honour to a
possible founder. Rich men can always be
found to vie with one another in lavish expenditure
over a ball or a wedding. Thousands of
pounds go for a racehorse and for stable
management generally, and the amount we
spend upon sports annually is 38,000,000<i>l.</i>, or
about a pound per head of the population.
One hardly likes to say that any sum spent
upon sport and outdoor life is too much, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a><a href="images/134.png">[134]</a></span>
yet this sum is out of proportion. One is
jealous of horses and sport, not so much
perhaps for the amount spent upon them as
much as because one sees that the man who
hunts and has racehorses, cares and knows about
these things to the extermination of all other
interests. Life becomes ill balanced, whereas it
is necessary to touch life at many points. 'The
strenuous scholar pure and simple,' is becoming
more rare, though the type of which the late
Mark Pattison was one will never quite die
out. But it is not the strenuous <i>scholar</i> that
one is so anxious to perpetuate, as it is the
strenuous and scholarly man of affairs and
men of trained ability who have mental muscle
for parliamentary work and social problems.
Such a class ought to have many recruits
from among the wealthier families.</p>

<p>It would assist very much towards this end
if men of aptitude were properly trained to act
as custodians of books in private houses. The
art of knowing how to use books is one which
must be learnt, and when properly learnt there
is very little indeed that may not be readily
found to hand in a library of but small dimensions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a><a href="images/135.png">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>There are, I believe, in England twenty-two
packs of staghounds, and 182 packs of
foxhounds. As every one of the masters of
these packs must be a rich man, I should
like to know that he at any rate had a sound
copy of the <i>History</i> of the county where he
hunts; that he had in his smoking room a
good Encyclop&aelig;dia, with fifty other good
reference books, and a hundred good novels.</p>

<p>The rich men of old combined patronage
of learning with the pomp and splendour of
their lives. Lucullus distinguished himself by
his vast collection of books, and the liberal
access he allowed to lovers of books. 'It
was a library,' says Plutarch, 'whose walls,
galleries and cabinets were open to all visitors;
and the ingenious youths, when at leisure,
resorted to this abode of the Muses, to hold
literary conversations, in which Lucullus himself
loved to join.' The Emperor Augustus
was himself an author and a book lover, and
called one of his libraries by the name of
his sister, Octavia, and the other the temple
of Apollo. Tiberius had a library, and Trajan
also, and these spent constantly upon their
books and the housing of them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a><a href="images/136.png">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>I have taken from Renaissance history
pictures of several men who might be taken
as types which should exist in every highly
civilised country. They have been vividly and
admirably pictured by biographers, and one can
only hope that the rich men of to-day may in
five hundred years' time have as lasting reputations
as that of Cosimo, the princely patron
of learning, and Niccolo, the man of scholarship
and refinement of life.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><h2><i>PASSAGES ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE FOREGOING.</i></h2></div>




<h2><span class='u'><i>The Medici and their Friends.</i></span></h2>


<p>'The chief benefit conferred by Cosimo de' Medici
on learning was the accumulation and the housing
of large libraries. During his exile he built the
library of S. Giorgio Maggiore at Venice, and
after his return to Florence he formed three
separate collections of MSS. While the hall
of the Library of S. Marco was in process of
construction, Niccolo de' Niccoli died, in 1437,
bequeathing his 800 MSS., valued at 6000 golden
florins, to sixteen trustees. Among these were
Cosimo and Lorenzo de' Medici, Ambrogio Traversari,
Lionardo Bruni, Carlo Marsuppini, Poggio
Bracciolini, Giannozzo Manetti, and Franco Sachetti.
At the same time the estate of Niccolo was compromised
by heavy debts. These debts Cosimo
cancelled, obtaining in exchange the right to dispose
of the library. In 1441 the hall of the convent was
finished. Four hundred of Niccolo's MSS. were
placed there, with this inscription upon each: <i>Ex
hereditate doctissimi viri Nicola de Nicolis de Florenti&acirc;</i>.
Tommasso Parentucelli made a catalogue at Cosimo's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a><a href="images/138.png">[138]</a></span>
request, in which he not only noted the titles of
Niccoli's books, but also marked the names of others
wanting to complete the collection. This catalogue
afterwards served as a guide to the founders of the
libraries of Fiesole, Urbino, and Pesaro, and was,
says Vespasiano, indispensable to book-collectors.
Of the remaining 400 volumes Cosimo kept some
for his own (the Medicean) library, and some he gave
to his friends. At the same time he spared no pains
to buy codices, while Vespasiano and Fra Giuliano
Lapaccini were employed in copying rare MSS.
As soon as Cosimo had finished building the
Abbey of Fiesole, he set about providing this also
with a library suited to the wants of learned ecclesiastics.
Of the method he pursued, Vespasiano,
who acted as his agent, has transmitted the following
account:&mdash;"One day when I was in his room, he said
to me, 'What plan can you recommend for the
formation of this library?' I answered that to buy
the books would be impossible, since they could not
be purchased. 'What, then, do you propose?' he
added. I told him that they must be copied. He
then asked if I would undertake the business. I
replied that I was willing. He bade me begin at
my leisure, saying that he left all to me; and for the
monies wanted day by day, he ordered that Don
Arcangelo, at that time prior of the monastery,
should draw cheques upon his bank, which should
be honoured. After beginning the collection, since
it was his will that it should be finished with all speed
possible, and money was not lacking, I soon engaged
forty-five copyists, and in twenty-two months provided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a><a href="images/139.png">[139]</a></span>
two hundred volumes, following the admirable
list furnished by Pope Nicholas V."'<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>'Cosimo's zeal for learning was not confined to the
building of libraries or to book collecting. His
palace formed the centre of a literary and philosophical
Society, which united all the wits of Florence
and the visitors who crowded to the capital of
culture. Vespasiano states that "he was always the
father and benefactor of those who showed any
excellence." Distinguished by versatility of tastes
and comprehensive intellect, he formed his own
opinion of the men of eminence with whom he came
in contact, and conversed with each upon his special
subject. When giving audience to the scholars, he
discoursed concerning letters; in the company of
theologians he showed his acquaintance with theology,
a branch of learning always studied by him with
delight. So also with regard to philosophy.
Astrologers found him well versed in their science,
for he somewhat lent faith to astrology, and employed
it on certain private occasions. Musicians in like
manner perceived his mastery of music, wherein he
much delighted. The same was true about sculpture
and painting: both of these arts he understood completely,
and showed great favour to all worthy
craftsmen. In architecture he was a consummate
judge, for without his opinion and advice no building
was begun or carried to completion.'<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a><a href="images/140.png">[140]</a></span></p><p>'Never was there a time in the world's history
when money was spent more freely upon the collection
and preservation of MSS. and when a more
complete machinery was put in motion for the
sake of securing literary treasures. Prince vied with
prince, and eminent burgher with burgher, in buying
books. The commercial correspondents of the
Medici and other great Florentine houses, whose
banks and discount offices extended over Europe
and the Levant, were instructed to purchase relics
of antiquity without regard for cost, and to forward
them to Florence. The most acceptable present
that could be sent to a king was a copy of a
Roman Historian.'<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>'Among the friends of Cosimo, to whose personal
influences at Florence the Revival of Learning owed
a vigorous impulse, Niccolo de' Niccoli claims our
attention.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. His judgment in matters of style
was so highly valued that it was usual for scholars to
submit their essays to his eyes before they ventured
upon publication.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Notwithstanding his fine
sense of language, Niccolo never appeared before
the world of letters as an author.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Certainly his
reserve in an age noteworthy for display has tended
to confer on him distinction. The position he
occupied at Florence was that of a literary dictator.
All who needed his assistance and advice were
received with urbanity. He threw his house open to
young men of parts, engaged in disputations with the
curious, and provided the ill-educated with teachers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a><a href="images/141.png">[141]</a></span>
Foreigners from all parts of Europe paid him visits.
The strangers who came to Florence at that time, if
they missed the opportunity of seeing him at home,
thought they had not been in Florence. The house
where he lived was worthy of his refined taste and
cultivated judgment, for he had formed a museum of
antiquities&mdash;inscriptions, marbles, coins, vases, and
engraved gems. There he not only received students
and strangers, but conversed with sculptors and
painters, discussing their inventions as freely as he
criticised the essays of the scholars.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Vespasiano's
account of his personal habits presents so vivid a
picture that I cannot refrain from translating it at
length:&mdash;"First of all, he was of a most fair presence;
lively, for a smile was ever on his lips, and very
pleasant in his talk. He wore clothes of the fairest
crimson cloth, down to the ground. He never
married, in order that he might not be impeded in his
studies. A housekeeper provided for his daily needs.
He was, above all men, the most cleanly in eating, as
also in all other things. When he sat at table, he ate
from fair antique vases, and, in like manner, all his
table was covered with porcelain and other vessels of
great beauty. The cup from which he drank was of
crystal, or of some other precious stone. To see him
at table&mdash;a perfect model of the men of old&mdash;was of a
truth a charming sight. He always willed that the
napkins set before him should be of the whitest, as
well as all the linen." .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What distinguished
Niccolo was the combination of refinement and
humane breeding with open-handed generosity and
devotion to the cause of culture. He knew how to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a><a href="images/142.png">[142]</a></span>
bring forward men of promise and place them in
positions of eminence.'<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>'Lorenzo attracted to his villa the greatest
scholars and most brilliant men of the time, a
circle which included Poliziano, Landino, Ficino,
Pico della Mirandola, Alberti, Pulci, and Michael
Angelo. The interests of this circle, as of all similar
Italian circles of the time, were largely absorbed in
the philosophy and literature of Greece, and special
attention was devoted to the teachings of Plato.
Plato's writings were translated into Latin by Ficino,
and the translation was printed in 1482, at the cost of
Filippo Valvio. Ficino was too poor himself to
undertake the publication of his works, and this was
the case with not a few of the distinguished authors
of the age. The presentation of books to the public
required at this time what might be called the endowment
of literature, and endowment which was supplied
by the liberality of wealthy patrons possessed of
literary appreciation or public-spirited ambition, or of
both. As Symonds expresses it, "Great literary
undertakings involved in that century the substantial
assistance of wealthy men, whose liberality was
rewarded by a notice in the colophon or in the
title-page." The formal dedication was an invention
of a somewhat later date.'<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>'Of Palla degli Strozzi's services in the cause of
Greek learning I have already spoken. Beside the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a><a href="images/143.png">[143]</a></span>
invitation which he caused to be sent to Manuel
Chrysoloras, he employed his wealth and influence in
providing books necessary for the prosecution of
Hellenic studies. "Messer Palla," says Vespasiano,
"sent to Greece for countless volumes, all at his own
cost. The <i>Cosmography</i> of Ptolemy, together with the
picture made to illustrate it, the <i>Lives</i> of Plutarch,
the works of Plato, and very many other writings
of philosophers, he got from Constantinople. The
<i>Politics</i> of Aristotle were not in Italy until Messer
Palla sent for them; and when Messer Lionardo of
Arezzo translated them, he had the copy from his
hands." In the same spirit of practical generosity
Palla degli Strozzi devoted his leisure and his
energies to the improvement of the <i>studio pubblico</i>
at Florence, giving it that character of humane culture
which it retained throughout the age of the Renaissance.
To him, again, belongs the glory of having first
collected books for the express purpose of founding
a public library. This project had occupied the mind
of Petrarch, and its utility had been recognised by
Coluccio de' Salutati, but no one had as yet arisen
to accomplish it. "Being passionately fond of
literature, Messer Palla always kept copyists in his
own house and outside it, of the best who were in
Florence, both for Greek and Latin books; and all
the books he could find he purchased, on all subjects,
being minded to found a most noble library in Santa
Trinit&agrave;, and to erect there a most beautiful building
for the purpose. He wished that it should be open
to the public, and he chose Santa Trinit&agrave; because it
was in the centre of Florence, a site of great convenience<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a><a href="images/144.png">[144]</a></span>
to everybody. His disasters supervened
and what he had designed he could not execute."'<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>'Cosimo used to regret that "he had not begun to
spend money upon public works ten years earlier
than he did." Every costly building that bore his
name, each library he opened to the public, and all
the donations lavished upon scholars, served the
double purpose of cementing the despotism of his
house and of gratifying his personal enthusiasm for
culture.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Of his generosity to men of letters, the
most striking details are recorded. When Niccolo
de' Niccoli ruined himself, Cosimo opened for him an
unlimited credit with the Medicean bank.'<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>




<h2><span class="u"><i>The Dukes of Urbino.</i></span></h2>


<p>'Mr. Roscoe has observed that "by no circumstance
in the character of an individual is the love of
literature so strongly evinced as by the propensity for
collecting together the writings of illustrious scholars,
and compressing the 'soul of ages past' within the
narrow limits of a library." But it is not easy now to
appreciate the obstacles attending such a pursuit in
the age of Federigo. The science of bibliography can
scarcely be said to have existed before the invention
of printing, in consequence of the extreme difficulty
of becoming acquainted with works of which there
were but few copies, and these widely scattered,
perhaps scarcely known. Great outlay was required,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a><a href="images/145.png">[145]</a></span>
either to search out or transcribe manuscripts, and
even the laborious habits which then accompanied
learning shrank from a task so beset by obstructions.
Yet there was a bright exception in Thomas of
Saranza, whose learning supplied the knowledge, and
whose elevation to the triple tiara as Nicholas V. procured
him the opportunities necessary for amassing a
library. Not only did he found that of the Vatican,
but he prepared for Cosimo, <i>Pater patrie</i>, a list of
authors for the infant collection of S. Marco, at
Florence, which, being recognised as a standard
catalogue, was adopted by Count Federigo. The
longer life allowed to the latter enabled him to
outstrip these bibliomaniacs, and all contemporary
accumulators, until the fame of his library stood
unrivalled. Accordingly Ruscelli, in his <i>Imprese
Illustri</i>, avers it to be "notorious that the earliest
and most famous collection formed out of the ruins
of antiquity was that of Urbino, from whence many
excellent authors were edited, and copies supplied."'<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>'In no respect did he look to expense; and whenever
he learned the existence of any desirable book in
Italy, or abroad, he sent for it without heeding the
cost. His librarian, Vespasiano, wrote, "It is now
above fourteen years since he began to make this
collection, and he has ever since at Urbino, Florence,
and elsewhere, thirty-four transcribers, and has
resorted to every means requisite for amassing a
famous and excellent library."'<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>'To the right and left of the carriage entrance
into the great courtyard, are two handsome saloons,
each about forty-five feet by twenty-two, and twenty-three
in height. That on the left contained the
famous library of manuscripts collected by Count
Federigo; the corresponding one received the printed
books, which, gradually purchased by successive
dukes, became under the last sovereign, a copious
collection. Baldi, in his description of the palace,
printed in Bianchini's work, dwells on the judicious
adaptation of the former, its windows set high against
the northern sky, admitting a subdued and steady
light which invited to study; its air cool in summer,
temperate in winter; its walls conveniently shelved;
the character and objects of the place fittingly set
forth in a series of rude hexameters inscribed on the
cornices. Adjoining was a closet fitted up with
inlaid and gilded panelling, beneath which Timoteo
della Vite, a painter whose excellence we shall attest
in our thirtieth chapter, depicted Minerva with her
&aelig;gis, Apollo with his lyre, and the nine muses with
their appropriate symbols. A similar small study
was fitted up immediately over this one, set round
with arm-chairs encircling a table, all mosaicked with
<i>tarsia</i>, and carved by Maestro Giacomo of Florence,
while on each compartment of the panelling was the
portrait of some famous author, and an appropriate
distich. One other article of furniture deserves
special notice&mdash;a magnificent eagle of gilt bronze,
serving as a lectern in the centre of the manuscript
room. It was carried to Rome at the devolution of
the duchy to the Holy See, but was rescued by Pope<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a><a href="images/147.png">[147]</a></span>

<p>'Of Francesco Maria's literary pursuits we have
various pleasing memorials. Not satisfied with the
valuable library of MSS. that had descended to him
from the Feltrian dukes, he formed another of
standard printed works. Indeed, he became an
assiduous book-collector; and the letters of his
librarian, Benedetto Benedetti, in the Oliveriana
Library, are full of lists which his agents in Venice,
Florence, and even Frankfort are urged to supply.
In his own voluminous correspondence, we find
constant offers from authors of dedications or copies
of their productions, the tone of which is highly complimentary
to his taste for letters. In 1603, the
Archbishop of Monreale, in Spain, transmits him
the regulations he proposed to prescribe in bequeathing
his library to a seminary he had founded
in his diocese, expressing a hope that they might
prove useful to the Duke's collection, "at this moment
without parallel in the world." Instead of quoting
the vague testimony of courtly compliment, as to the
use which this philosophic Prince made of these acquisitions,
let us cite the brief records of his studies,
preserved in his own Diary. In 1585, "terminated
an inspection of the whole works of Aristotle, on
which I have laboured no less than fifteen years,
having had them generally read to me by Maestro
Cesare Benedetti, of Pesaro."'<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>'Francesco di Giorgio, in his <i>Treatise on Architecture</i>,
mentions Duke Federigo as holding out
inducements for the learned men at his court to
illustrate the works of classic authors on architecture
and sculpture. But no testimony to his literary habits
can be more satisfactory than that of his librarian,
Vespasiano, to the following purpose. The Duke
was a ready Latin scholar, and extremely fond of
ancient history. As a logician he had attained considerable
aptitude, having studied Aristotle's <i>Ethics</i>
along with Maestro Lazzaro, a famous theologian,
who became Bishop of Urbino, discussing with him
the most intricate passages. By the like process he
mastered the Stagirite's politics, physics, and other
treatises; and having acquired more philosophy than
any contemporary prince, his thirst for new sources of
knowledge induced him to devote himself to theology
with equal zeal. The principal works of St. Thomas
Aquinas and Duns Scotus were habitually read to
him; he preferred the former as more clear, but
admitted that the latter displayed more subtlety in
argument. He was well acquainted with the Bible,
as well as the commentaries of Saints Ambrose,
Jerome, Augustine, and Gregory; also with the writings
of the Greek fathers, such as Saints Basil, Chrysostom,
Gregory Naziazen, Nicetas, Athanasius, and
Cyril. Among the classic authors whom he was in
the habit of reading or listening to were Livy,
Sallust, Quintus Curtius, Justin, C&aelig;sar, Plutarch,
&AElig;lius Spartianus, &AElig;mylius Protus, Tacitus,
Suetonius, Eusebius. All men of letters visiting
Urbino were hospitably entertained, and several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a><a href="images/149.png">[149]</a></span>
were always attached to his court. His largesses to
such were at all times liberal. He spent above 1500
ducats in this way when at Florence, and remitted
similar bounties to Rome and Naples. He gave 1000
ducats to the learned Campano, professor of belles-lettres
at Perugia in 1455, who aided him in collecting
ancient MSS., and became Bishop of Teramo.'<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>




<h2><span class='u'><i>Pieresc.</i></span></h2>


<p>'When any library was to be sold by public outcry,
he took care to buy the best books, especially
if they were of some neat edition that he did not
already possess. He bound his books in red morocco,
with his cypher or initials in gold. One binder
always lived in the house, and sometimes several
were employed at once "when the books came
rolling in on every side."' 'Your house and library'
(says the dedication of a book to Pieresc) 'are a
firmament wherein the stars of learning shine; the
desks are lit with starlight, and the books are in
constellations, and you sit like the sun in the midst,
embracing and giving light to them all.' 'The
library is to be open to all the world without the
exception of any living soul; readers were to
be supplied with chairs and writing materials, and
the attendants will fetch all books required in any
language or department of learning, and will change
them as often as is necessary.'<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>'Bouchard states, in his funeral oration on Pieresc,
"To this his shop and storehouse of wisdom and
virtue, Peireskius did not only courteously admit all
travellers, studious of art and learning, opening to
them all the treasures of his library, but he would
keep them there a long time, with free and liberal
entertainment; and at their departure, would give
them books, coins, and other things, which seemed
most suitable to their studies; also he freely gave
them at his own expense, whatever things they
wanted, most liberally, even as to all other learned
men, who were absent, and whose names he had
only heard of; whatever he had among his books
or relics of antiquity, which he thought might
assist them in their writings, he would send it them of
his own accord, not only without their desiring the
same, but many times when they were ignorant of
such things.'<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>




<h2><span class="u"><i>Mr. Ruskin's Advice.</i></span></h2>


<p>'I say first we have despised literature. What do
we, as a nation, care about books? How much do
you think we spend altogether on our libraries, public or
private, as compared with what we spend on our horses?
If a man spends lavishly on his library, you call him
mad&mdash;a biblio-maniac. But you never call any one a
horse maniac, though men ruin themselves every day
by their horses, and you do not hear of people ruining
themselves by their books. Or, to go lower still,
how much do you think the bookshelves of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a><a href="images/151.png">[151]</a></span>
United Kingdom, public and private, would fetch, as
compared with the contents of its wine-cellars?
What position would its expenditure on literature
take as compared with its expenditure on luxurious
eating? We talk of food for the mind, as of food for
the body: now a good book contains such food inexhaustibly;
it is a provision for life, and for the best
part of us; yet how long most people would look at
the best book before they would give the price of a
large turbot for it!'<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>'It will be long yet before that comes to pass.
Nevertheless, I hope it will not be long before royal
or national libraries will be founded in every considerable
city, with a royal series of books in them;
the same series in every one of them, chosen books,
the best in every kind, prepared for that national
series in the most perfect way possible; their text
printed all on leaves of equal size, broad of margin, and
divided into pleasant volumes, light in the hand,
beautiful and strong, and thorough as examples of
binder's work.'<a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

somewhat exigeant classes of correspondents: the young
gentlemen who wish me to give them a list of the works
requisite to form a journalist's library; and, next, the
esteemed individuals of both sexes and all ages who want
me to tell them how to keep a commonplace-book. I
have replied to both these questions over and over again;
and to give yet another list of the books which I think would
be useful to professional writers for the press would be to
outrage the patience of my non-professional patrons. The
recipe for keeping a commonplace-book may, however, it
is to be hoped, be repeated without giving offence to any
one. Here it is; and pray observe that I have had it
printed in small type, in order that the susceptibilities of
readers who want to be amused and do not require to be
instructed may not be wounded:&mdash;Procure a blank book,
strongly bound, big or little, according to the largeness or
smallness of your handwriting. Let the book have an
index. It will be better if the paper of the book were
ruled. When in the course of your reading you come on
a passage which strikes you as worthy of being common-placed,
copy it legibly in your commonplace-book. Say
that the passage is the following, from Bacon's <i>Natural
History:</i> "So the beard is younger than the hair of the
head, and doth, for the most part, wax hoary later." At
the end of this passage inscribe a circle or an ellipse, a
square or a lozenge, just as you choose to do; and in the
inscribed space write with red ink (better still with carmine)
the figure 1. Then index the passage under letter B.
"Beard younger than hair of head. 1." If you wish to be
very careful in your common-placing, you may double index
the passage by turning to letter H, and indicating the
passage as "Head, hair of, older than beard." And so you
may continue to transcribe consecutively all the passages
which strike you in the course of your reading: never
omitting to number the passage and to index it as soon as
numbered. That is the system adopted by the Distressed
Compiler, and he has made constant use of it for nearly
forty years.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">G. A. Sala.</span></p></div>

and the knowledge of the lawyer, if he is competent,
gradually becomes of the kind which qualifies him to be a

that his librarian at Paris did not keep him well supplied
with books. "The Emperor," wrote the secretary to
Barbier, "wants a portable library of a thousand volumes
in 12mo., printed in good type without margin, and composed
as nearly as possible of forty volumes on religion,
forty of epics, forty of plays, sixty of poetry, a hundred of
novels, sixty of history, the remainder, to make up the
thousand, of historical memoirs. The religious works are
to be the Old and New Testament, the Koran, a selection
of the works of the Fathers of the Church, works respecting
the Aryans, Calvinists, of Mythology, &amp;c. The epics are
to be Homer, Lucan, Tasso, Telemachus, The Henriade,

Voltaire, Corneille, Racine, and Rousseau were also among
the authors mentioned.'</p></div>

book-cases or other shelves, the adjustment of which has,
from time to time, to be varied to suit the varying requirements
of a library, &amp;c. The method hitherto generally
adopted for such shelves is to support them at each end by
two studs, the heads of which are mortised into the shelf,
and the pins driven or otherwise fitted into holes two or
more inches apart, bored in two rows into the upright
frames; these holes are very seldom accurately fitted to the
pins, and even where so done in the first instance, from the
shrinking or expansion of the wood, they soon become too
large or too small for the pins, and the alteration of the
adjustment of a shelf is thereby rendered an extremely
troublesome operation. The patent fittings remedy this,
and save both time and trouble; in place of the rows of
holes so far apart, metal strips perforated at intervals of
three-quarters of an inch for the reception of the very simple
but strong metal plates, which take the place of the old
studs, are mortised in and screwed to the frames. The
insertion, at the required intervals, of the plates into the
perforations in these strips is made instantaneously, consequently
the position of a shelf can be easily altered without
an irritating expense of trouble, and waste of time. The
thinness of the plates renders any mortising in the shelf
unnecessary, and the small intervals between the perforations
in the strips enables the whole space occupied by the
shelves to be used most economically. These fittings,
when used with a shelf sufficiently strong itself to bear the
weight, will support without strain more than half a ton.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_51_51" id="Footnote_51_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51_51"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> These notices of the Hawarden Library may be compared
with the accounts given in Dennistoun's <i>Dukes of
Urbino</i> of a great Florentine library:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Adjoining (the main library) was a study, fitted up with
inlaid and gilded panelling, beneath which .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. were
depicted Minerva with her &aelig;gis, Apollo with his lyre, and
the nine muses, with their appropriate symbols. A similar
small study was fitted up immediately over this one, set
round with armchairs encircling a table, all mosaicked with
<i>tarsia</i>, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. while in each compartment of the panelling
was the portrait of some famous author, and an appropriate
distich.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. To the right and left of the carriage entrance
into the great courtyard are two handsome saloons, each
about forty-five feet by twenty-two, and twenty-three in
height. That on the left contained the famous library of
MS. collected by Count Federigo; the corresponding one
received the printed books which, gradually purchased by
successive dukes, became, under the last sovereign a copious
collection. Baldi, in his description of the palace, printed in
Bianchini's works, dwells on the judicious adaptation of the
former, its windows set high against the northern sky, admitting
a subdued and steady light which invited to study;
its air cool in summer, temperate in winter; its walls conveniently
sheltered.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.'</p></div>
